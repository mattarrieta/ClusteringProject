Liberalism
 Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on the rights of the individual, liberty, consent of the
governed and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law"] equality before the law.[1][2][3] Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their
understanding of these principles, but they generally support individual rights (including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights"] civil rights and
 human rights), liberal democracy, secularism, rule of law, economic and political freedom, freedom of
speech, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press"] freedom of the press, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion"] freedom of religion, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property"] private property and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy"] market economy.[11]
Liberalism became a distinct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_movement"] movement in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment"] Age of Enlightenment, gaining popularity among [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"] Western
philosophers and economists. Liberalism sought to replace the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(social)"] norms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility"] hereditary privilege, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion"] state religion,
 absolute monarchy, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings"] divine right of kings and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_conservatism"] traditional conservatism with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy"] representative democracy
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law"] rule of law. Liberals also ended [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism"] mercantilist policies, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_monopoly"] royal monopolies and other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_barrier"] barriers to trade,
instead promoting free trade and marketization.[12] Philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"] John Locke is often credited with founding
liberalism as a distinct tradition, based on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract"] social contract, arguing that each man has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights"] natural right to
 life, liberty and property and governments must not violate these rights.[13] While the British liberal
tradition has emphasized expanding democracy, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_and_radicalism_in_France"] French liberalism has emphasized rejecting
 authoritarianism and is linked to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"] nation-building.[14]
 Leaders in the British Glorious Revolution of 1688,[15] the American Revolution of 1776 and the French
Revolution of 1789 used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of royal sovereignty. Liberalism
started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments
established in nations across [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_Europe"] Europe and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_and_conservatism_in_Latin_America"] South America, whereas it was well-established alongside
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States"] republicanism in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States"] United States.[16] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Britain"] Victorian Britain, it was used to critique the political
establishment, appealing to science and reason on behalf of the people.[17] During 19th and early 20th
century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_Turkey"] liberalism in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East influenced periods of reform such as the
 Tanzimat and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nahda"] Al-Nahda as well as the rise of constitutionalism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"] nationalism and secularism. These changes,
along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within Islam, which continues to this day, leading
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_revivalism"] Islamic revivalism. Before 1920, the main ideological opponents of liberalism were communism,
 conservatism and socialism,[18] but liberalism then faced major ideological challenges from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism"] fascism and
 Marxism–Leninism as new opponents. During the 20th century, liberal ideas spread even further, especially
in Western Europe, as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy"] liberal democracies found themselves as the winners in both world wars.[19]
In Europe and North America, the establishment of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism"] social liberalism (often called simply [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States"] liberalism in the
United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state"] welfare state.[20] Today, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party"] liberal parties
 continue to wield power and influence throughout the world. The fundamental elements of contemporary
society have liberal roots. The early waves of liberalism popularised economic individualism while
expanding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"] constitutional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"] government and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament"] parliamentary authority.[12] Liberals sought and established a
 constitutional order that prized important individual freedoms, such as freedom of speech and freedom of
association; an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_the_judiciary"] independent judiciary and public [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial"] trial by jury; and the abolition of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy_(class)"] aristocratic privileges.[12]
Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil
rights.[21] Liberals have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy"] advocated gender and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a
 global civil rights movement in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Other
goals often accepted by liberals include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage"] universal suffrage and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_access_to_education"] universal access to education.

Etymology and definition
Words such as [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Liberal"] liberal, [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Liberty"] liberty, [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Libertarianism"] libertarian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertine"] libertine all trace their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology"] etymology to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics)"] root [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Liber"] liber,
which means "free".[22] One of the first recorded instances of the word liberal occurs in 1375, when it was
used to describe the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts"] liberal arts in the context of an education desirable for a free-born man.[22] The word's
early connection with the classical education of a medieval university soon gave way to a proliferation of
different denotations and connotations. Liberal could refer to "free in bestowing" as early as 1387, "made
without stint" in 1433, "freely permitted" in 1530 and "free from restraint"—often as a pejorative remark—
in the 16th and the 17th centuries.[22] In 16th century England, liberal could have positive or negative
 attributes in referring to someone's generosity or indiscretion.[22] In Much Ado About Nothing, William
Shakespeare wrote of "a liberal villaine" who "hath [...] confest his vile encounters".[22] With the rise of the
Enlightenment, the word acquired decisively more positive undertones, being defined as "free from narrow
prejudice" in 1781 and "free from bigotry" in 1823.[22] In 1815, the first use of the word "liberalism"
appeared in English.[23] In Spain, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_and_radicalism_in_Spain"] liberales, the first group to use the liberal label in a political
context,[24] fought for decades for the implementation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Constitution_of_1812"] 1812 Constitution. From 1820 to 1823 during
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trienio_Liberal"] Trienio Liberal,  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain"] King Ferdinand VII was compelled by the liberales to swear to uphold the
Constitution. By the middle of the 19th century, liberal was used as a politicised term for parties and
movements worldwide.[25]
Over time, the meaning of the word liberalism began to diverge in different parts of the world. According
to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica"] Encyclopædia Britannica: "In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state
policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt"] Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-
faire economic policies".[26] Consequently, in the United States the ideas of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism"] individualism and laissez-faire
economics previously associated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism"] classical liberalism became the basis for the emerging school of
 libertarian thought[27] and are key components of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States"] American conservatism.

In Europe and Latin America, the word liberalism means moderate form of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism"] classical liberalism, unlike
North America, and includes both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics"] centre-right [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_liberalism"] conservative liberalism (right-liberalism) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics"] centre-left
 social liberalism (left-liberalism).[28] Unlike Europe and Latin America, the word liberalism in North
America almost exclusively refers to social liberalism (left-liberalism). The dominant Canadian party is the
 Liberal Party and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"] Democratic Party is usually considered liberal in the United States.[29][30][31] In the
United States, conservative liberals are usually called conservatives in a broad sense.[32][33]

Philosophy
Liberalism—both as a political current and an intellectual tradition—is mostly a modern phenomenon that
started in the 17th century, although some liberal philosophical ideas had precursors in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"] classical antiquity
and in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China#Imperial_China"] Imperial China.[37][38] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_Emperors"] Roman Emperor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius"] Marcus Aurelius praised, "the idea of a polity
administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government
which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".[39] Scholars have also recognised a number of
principles familiar to contemporary liberals in the works of several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophism"] Sophists and in the Funeral Oration by
Pericles.[40] Liberal philosophy is the culmination of an extensive intellectual tradition that has examined
and popularized some of the most important and controversial principles of the modern world. Its immense
scholarly and academic output has been characterized as containing "richness and diversity", but that
diversity often has meant that liberalism comes in different formulations and presents a challenge to anyone
looking for a clear definition.[41]
Continental European liberalism is divided between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"] moderates and progressives, with the moderates
tending to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitism"] elitism and the progressives supporting the universalisation of fundamental institutions such as
 universal suffrage, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_access_to_education"] universal education and the expansion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights"] property rights. Over time, the moderates
displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism.[14]
Major themes
Although all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage, scholars frequently assume that those doctrines
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_liberal_theorists"] contain "separate and often contradictory streams of thought".[41] The objectives of liberal theorists and
philosophers have differed across various times, cultures and continents. The diversity of liberalism can be
gleaned from the numerous qualifiers that liberal thinkers and movements have attached to the very term
"liberalism",  including classical, egalitarian, economic, social, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state"] welfare state, ethical, humanist,
deontological, perfectionist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy"] democratic and institutional, to name a few.[42] Despite these variations, liberal
thought does exhibit a few definite and fundamental conceptions.
Political philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gray_(philosopher)"] John Gray identified the common strands in liberal thought as being individualist,
egalitarian, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meliorism"] meliorist and universalist. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human
being against the pressures of social collectivism, the egalitarian element assigns the same [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality"] moral worth and
status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their
sociopolitical arrangements and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and
marginalises local [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"] cultural differences.[43] The meliorist element has been the subject of much controversy,
defended by thinkers such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant"] Immanuel Kant who believed in human progress while suffering criticism by
thinkers such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau"] Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who instead believed that human attempts to improve themselves
through social [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"] cooperation would fail.[44] Describing the liberal temperament, Gray claimed that it "has
been inspired by scepticism and by a fideistic certainty of divine revelation [...] it has exalted the power of
reason even as, in other contexts, it has sought to humble reason's claims".

The liberal philosophical tradition has searched for validation and justification through several intellectual
projects. The moral and political suppositions of liberalism have been based on traditions such as natural
rights and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism"] utilitarian theory, although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and
religious circles.[43] Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major
common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_liberty"] individual liberty, supporting private property
and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the
importance of related values such as pluralism, toleration, autonomy, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity"] bodily integrity and consent.[45]
Classical and modern
John Locke and Thomas Hobbes
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment"] Enlightenment philosophers are given credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together
and systematized as a distinct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology"] ideology by the English philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"] John Locke, generally regarded as the
father of modern liberalism.[46][47] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes"] Thomas Hobbes attempted to determine the purpose and the justification
of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature"] state of nature — a
hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the state — he constructed the idea of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract"] social contract that
individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an
 absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such security. Hobbes had developed the concept of the
social contract, according to which individuals in the anarchic and brutal state of nature came together and
voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws
to regulate social interactions to mitigate or mediate conflicts and enforce justice. Whereas Hobbes
advocated a strong monarchical commonwealth (the Leviathan), Locke developed the then-radical notion
that government acquires [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed"] consent from the governed which has to be constantly present for the government
to remain legitimate.[48] While adopting Hobbes's idea of a state of nature and social contract, Locke
nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, it constitutes a violation of the social contract,
which protects life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the people have a right to
overthrow a tyrant. By placing the security of life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and
authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early
enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life—[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty"] liberty and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property"] private property among
them—required the formation of a "sovereign" authority with universal jurisdiction.[49]
His influential [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Treatises_of_Government"] Two Treatises (1690), the foundational text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas.
Once humans moved out of their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature"] natural state and formed societies, Locke argued, "that which begins and
actually constitutes any [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"] political society is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a
majority to unite and incorporate into such a society. And this is that, and that only, which did or could give
beginning to any lawful government in the world".[50] The stringent insistence that lawful government did
not have a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural"] supernatural basis was a sharp break with the dominant theories of governance which advocated
the divine right of kings[51] and echoed the earlier thought of Aristotle. One political scientist described this
new thinking as follows: "In the liberal understanding, there are no citizens within the regime who can
claim to rule by natural or supernatural right, without the consent of the governed".[52]
Locke had other intellectual opponents besides Hobbes. In the First Treatise, Locke aimed his arguments
first and foremost at one of the doyens of 17th century English conservative philosophy: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Filmer"] Robert Filmer.
Filmer's Patriarcha (1680) argued for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings"] divine right of kings by appealing to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible"] biblical teaching, claiming
that the authority granted to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam"] Adam by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"] God gave successors of Adam in the male line of descent a right of
dominion over all other humans and creatures in the world.[53] However, Locke disagreed so thoroughly
and obsessively with Filmer that the First Treatise is almost a sentence-by-sentence refutation of
Patriarcha. Reinforcing his respect for consensus, Locke argued that "conjugal society is made up by a
voluntary compact between men and women".[54] Locke maintained that the grant of dominion in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis"] Genesis
Page 5
was not to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege"] men over women, as Filmer believed, but to humans over animals.[54] Locke was certainly no
 feminist by modern standards, but the first major liberal thinker in history accomplished an equally major
task on the road to making the world more pluralistic: the integration of women into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_theory"] social theory.[54]
 Locke also originated the concept of the separation of church and
state.[55] Based on the social contract principle, Locke argued that the
government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as
this was something rational people could not cede to the government
for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the
liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected
from any government authority.[56] He also formulated a general
defence for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_toleration"] religious toleration in his Letters Concerning Toleration.
Three arguments are central: (1) earthly judges, the state in particular,
and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-
claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) even if they could,
enforcing a single "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism#Religious"] true religion" would not have the desired effect
because belief cannot be compelled by violence; (3) coercing religious
uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing
diversity.[57]
Locke was also influenced by the liberal ideas of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian"] Presbyterian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton"] John Milton's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica"] Areopagitica (1644)
politician and poet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton"] John Milton, who was a staunch advocate of
freedom in all its forms.[58] Milton argued for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disestablishment"] disestablishment as the 
argued for the importance of
 freedom of speech
only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a
man's conscience, government should recognise the persuasive force
of the gospel.[59] As assistant to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell"] Oliver Cromwell, Milton also took part in drafting a constitution of the
 independents (Agreement of the People; 1647) that strongly stressed the equality of all humans as a
consequence of democratic tendencies.[60] In his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica"] Areopagitica, Milton provided one of the first arguments
for the importance of freedom of speech—"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to
conscience, above all liberties". His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to
distinguish right from wrong. To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the
ideas of his fellow men in "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_of_ideas"] a free and open encounter" and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.
 In a natural state of affairs, liberals argued, humans were driven by the instincts of survival and self-
preservation and the only way to escape from such a dangerous existence was to form a common and
supreme power capable of arbitrating between competing human desires.[61] This power could be formed
in the framework of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society"] civil society that allows individuals to make a voluntary social contract with the
sovereign authority, transferring their natural rights to that authority in return for the protection of life,
liberty and property.[61] These early liberals often disagreed about the most appropriate form of
government, but they all shared the belief that liberty was natural and that its restriction needed strong
justification.[61] Liberals generally believed in limited government, although several liberal philosophers
decried government outright, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine"] Thomas Paine writing "government even in its best state is a necessary
evil".[62]
James Madison and Montesquieu
As part of the project to limit the powers of government, liberal theorists such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison and
 Montesquieu conceived the notion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"] separation of powers, a system designed to equally distribute
governmental authority among the executive, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature"] legislative and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary"] judicial branches.[62] Governments had to
realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the
ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and revolution, if
Page 6
needed.[63] Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support
limited [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution#Governmental_constitutions"] constitutional government while also advocating for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_services"] state services and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisioning"] provisions to ensure equal
rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights are irrelevant when
individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism"] greater role for government in
the administration of economic affairs.[64] Early liberals also laid the groundwork for the separation of
church and state. As heirs of the Enlightenment, liberals believed that any given social and political order
 emanated from human interactions, not from divine will.[65] Many liberals were openly hostile to religious
belief itself, but most concentrated their opposition to the union of religious and political authority, arguing
that faith could prosper on its own, without official sponsorship or administration by the state.[65]
Beyond identifying a clear role for government in modern society, liberals also have argued over the
meaning and nature of the most important principle in liberal philosophy, namely liberty. From the 17th
century until the 19th century, liberals (from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith"] Adam Smith to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill"] John Stuart Mill) conceptualised liberty as the
absence of interference from government and from other individuals, claiming that all people should have
the freedom to develop their own unique abilities and capacities without being sabotaged by others.[66]
Mill's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty"] On Liberty (1859), one of the classic texts in liberal philosophy, proclaimed, "the only freedom
which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way".[66] Support for laissez-faire
 capitalism is often associated with this principle, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek"] Friedrich Hayek arguing in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom"] The Road to Serfdom
(1944) that reliance on free markets would preclude totalitarian control by the state.[67]
Coppet Group and Benjamin Constant
 Madame de Staël 
The development into maturity of modern classical in contrast to ancient
liberalism took place before and soon after the French Revolution. One of
the historic centres of this development was at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppet_Castle"] Coppet Castle near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva"] Geneva
where the eponymous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppet_group"] Coppet group gathered under the aegis of the exiled
writer and salonnière, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germaine_de_Sta%C3%ABl"] Madame de Staël in the period between the
 establishment of Napoleon's First Empire (1804) and the Bourbon
Restoration of 1814–1815.[68][69][70][71] The unprecedented concentration
of European thinkers who met there was to have a considerable influence
on the development of nineteenth century liberalism and incidentally of
 romanticism.[72][73][74] They included Wilhelm von Humboldt, Jean de
 Sismondi, Charles Victor de Bonstetten, Prosper de Barante, Henry
Brougham, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron"] Lord Byron, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_de_Lamartine"] Alphonse de Lamartine, Sir [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mackintosh"] James Mackintosh,
 Juliette Récamier and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilhelm_Schlegel"] August Wilhelm Schlegel.[75]
Among them was also one of the first thinkers to go by the name of
"liberal", the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_University"] Edinburgh University-educated Swiss Protestant, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Constant"] Benjamin Constant, who looked to the
United Kingdom rather than to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome"] ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large mercantile society.
He drew a distinction between the "Liberty of the Ancients" and the "Liberty of the Moderns".[76] The
Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism"] republican liberty,[77] which gave the citizens the right to
influence politics directly through debates and votes in the public assembly.[76] In order to support this
degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment
of time and energy. Generally, this required a sub-group of slaves to do much of the productive work,
leaving citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and
homogenous male societies, in which they could congregate in one place to transact public affairs.[76]
The Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties"] civil liberties, the rule of law, and
freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence
of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a mercantile society in which
there were no slaves but almost everybody had to earn a living through work. Instead, the voters would
Page 7
elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf
of the people and would save citizens from daily political
involvement.[76] The importance of Constant's writings on the
liberty of the ancients and that of the "moderns" has informed
understanding of liberalism, as has his critique of the French
Revolution.[78] The British philosopher and historian of ideas, Sir
 Isaiah Berlin has pointed to the debt owed to Constant.[79]
British liberalism
 Liberalism in Britain was based on core concepts such as classical
economics, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade"] free trade, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire"] laissez-faire government with minimal
intervention and taxation and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget"] balanced budget. Classical liberals
were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. Writers
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bright"] John Bright and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cobden"] Richard Cobden opposed both aristocratic
privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the
development of a class of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeoman"] yeoman farmers.[80] 
 Benjamin Constant, a Franco-Swiss
political activist and theorist
Beginning in the late 19th century, a new conception of liberty entered the
liberal intellectual arena. This new kind of liberty became known as
 positive liberty to distinguish it from the prior [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty"] negative version and it was
first developed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_philosophy"] British philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hill_Green"] Thomas Hill Green. Green rejected
the idea that humans were driven solely by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-interest"] self-interest, emphasising
instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of our
 moral character.[81] In a very profound step for the future of modern
liberalism, he also tasked society and political institutions with the
enhancement of individual freedom and identity and the development of
moral character, will and reason and the state to create the conditions that
allow for the above, giving the opportunity for genuine choice.[81]
 Thomas Hill Green, an
influential [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_liberal_theorists"] liberal philosopher 
Foreshadowing the new liberty as the freedom to act rather than to avoid
suffering from the acts of others, Green wrote the following:
who established in
Prolegomena to Ethics
(1884) the first major
foundations for what later
 became known as positive
liberty and in a few years his 
If it were ever reasonable to wish that the usage of words had
been other than it has been [...] one might be inclined to wish
that the term 'freedom' had been confined to the [...] power to
do what one wills.[82]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_welfare_reforms"] ideas became the official
policy of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)"] Liberal Party in
Britain, precipitating the rise
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism"] social liberalism and the
modern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state"] welfare state 
Rather than previous liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by
selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole in which all
individuals have a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty"] duty to promote the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good"] common good.[83] His ideas spread
 rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as Leonard Trelawny
Hobhouse and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson"] John A. Hobson. In a few years, this New Liberalism had
become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain[84] and it would encircle
much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have
tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand
 suffrage rights, liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the democratic decision-making
process were liable to the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority"] tyranny of the majority", a concept explained in Mill's On Liberty and in
 Democracy in America (1835) by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville"] Alexis de Tocqueville.[85] As a response, liberals began demanding
proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_rights"] rights of minorities.[85]

Besides liberty, liberals have developed several other principles important to the construction of their
philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first
principle, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire"] Voltaire commented that "equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of
things".[86] All forms of liberalism assume in some basic sense that individuals are equal.[87] In maintaining
that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty.[88] In other
words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else and all
people are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law"] equal subjects before the law.[89] Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their
understanding of equality. American philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls"] John Rawls emphasised the need to ensure not only
equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to
develop their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"] aspirations in life.[89] Libertarian thinker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nozick"] Robert Nozick disagreed with Rawls, championing
the former version of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity"] Lockean equality instead.[89]
To contribute to the development of liberty, liberals also have promoted concepts like pluralism and
toleration. By pluralism, liberals refer to the proliferation of opinions and beliefs that characterise a stable
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_order"] social order.[90] Unlike many of their competitors and predecessors, liberals do not seek conformity and
homogeneity in the way that people think. In fact, their efforts have been geared towards establishing a
governing framework that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution"] harmonises and minimises conflicting views, but still allows those views to exist
and flourish.[91] For liberal philosophy, pluralism leads easily to toleration. Since individuals will hold
diverging viewpoints, liberals argue, they ought to uphold and respect the right of one another to
disagree.[92] From the liberal perspective, toleration was initially connected to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_toleration"] religious toleration, with
 Baruch Spinoza condemning "the stupidity of religious persecution and ideological wars".[92] Toleration
also played a central role in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantianism"] ideas of Kant and John Stuart Mill. Both thinkers believed that society will
contain different conceptions of a good ethical life and that people should be allowed to make their own
choices without interference from the state or other individuals.[92]
Liberal economic theory
 Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, followed by the French liberal economist, Jean-
Baptiste Say's treatise on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say%27s_Political_Economy"] Political Economy published in 1803 and expanded in 1830 with practical
applications, were to provide most of the ideas of economics until the publication of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill"] John Stuart Mill's
Principles in 1848.[93] Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing"] prices and the
 distribution of wealth and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy"] policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth.[94]
Smith wrote that as long as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand"] supply, demand, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"] prices and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)"] competition were left free of government regulation,
the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society[95] through
profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand"] invisible hand" directed individuals and firms to work
toward the nation's good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This
provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some
as sinful.[94]
Smith assumed that workers could be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary"] paid as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later
transformed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo"] David Ricardo and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus"] Thomas Robert Malthus into the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_wages"] iron law of wages".[96] His main
emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"] international trade, which he thought could increase wealth
through specialisation in production.[97] He also opposed restrictive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_preference"] trade preferences, state grants of
 monopolies and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employers%27_organisation"] employers' organisations and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"] trade unions.[98] Government should be limited to defence,
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_work"] public works and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_justice"] administration of justice, financed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax"] taxes based on income.[99] Smith was one of the
progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalisation"] globalisation
literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace.[100] Smith's economics
Page 9
 was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the Poor
 Relief Act that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the East India
Company over India in 1858.[101]
In his Treatise (Traité d'économie politique),  Say states that any production process requires effort,
knowledge and the "application" of the entrepreneur. He sees entrepreneurs as intermediaries in the
production process who combine productive factors such as land, capital and labour to meet the demand of
consumers. As a result, they play a central role in the economy through their coordinating function. He also
highlights qualities essential for successful entrepreneurship and focuses on judgement, in that they have
continuously to assess market needs and the means to meet them. This requires an "unerring market sense".
Say views entrepreneurial income primarily as the high revenue paid in compensation for their skills and
expert knowledge. He does so by contrasting the enterprise function and the supply-of-capital-function
which distinguishes the earnings of the entrepreneur on one hand and the remuneration of capital on the
other. This clearly differentiates his theory from that of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter"] Joseph Schumpeter, who describes entrepreneurial
rent as short-term profits which compensate for high risk (Schumpeterian rent). Say himself does also refer
to risk and uncertainty along with innovation, without analysing them in detail.
Say is also credited with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say%27s_law"] Say's law, or the law of markets which may be summarised as: "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_supply"] Aggregate supply
creates its own [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand"] aggregate demand",and "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_creates_its_own_demand"] Supply creates its own demand" or "Supply constitutes its own
demand" and "Inherent in supply is the need for its own consumption". The related phrase "supply creates
its own demand" was actually coined by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes"] John Maynard Keynes, who criticized Say's separate formulations
as amounting to the same thing. Some advocates of Say's law who disagree with Keynes, have claimed that
Say's law can actually be summarized more accurately as "production precedes consumption" and that
what Say is actually stating, is that for consumption to happen one must produce something of value so that
it can be traded for money or barter for consumption later.[102][103]Say argues, "products are paid for with
products" (1803, p. 153) or "a glut occurs only when too much resource is applied to making one product
and not enough to another" (1803, pp. 178–179).[104]
Related reasoning appears in the work of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill"] John Stuart Mill and earlier in that of his Scottish classical
economist father [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mill"] James Mill (1808).  Mill senior restates Say's law in 1808, writing: "production of
commodities creates, and is the one and universal cause which creates a market for the commodities
produced".[105]
 In addition to Smith's and Say's legacies, Thomas Malthus' theories of population and David Ricardo Iron
law of wages became central doctrines of classical economics.[106] Meanwhile, Jean-Baptiste Say
challenged Smith's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_theory_of_value"] labour theory of value, believing that prices were determined by utility and also
emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations
became accepted by British economists at the time. Malthus wrote [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population"] An Essay on the Principle of Population
in 1798,[107] becoming a major influence on classical liberalism. Malthus claimed that population growth
would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew
arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the
food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in
income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact
responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.[108]
Several liberals, including Adam Smith and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cobden"] Richard Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods
between nations would lead to world peace.[109] Smith argued that as societies progressed the spoils of war
would rise, but the costs of war would rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialised
nations.[110] Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a
small but concentrated elite minority; combining his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Englander"] Little Englander beliefs with opposition to the
economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated
peace must also advocate free markets.[111]

 Utilitarianism was seen as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)"] political justification for the implementation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism"] economic liberalism by British
governments, an idea dominating economic policy from the 1840s. Although utilitarianism prompted
legislative and administrative reform and John Stuart Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the
welfare state, it was mainly used as a premise for a laissez-faire approach.[112] The central concept of
utilitarianism, which was developed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham"] Jeremy Bentham, was that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy"] public policy should seek to provide
"the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state
action to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_reduction"] reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net
benefit to all individuals would be higher.[106] His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on
 government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government social control, including Robert
Peel's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police"] Metropolitan Police, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_reform"] prison reforms, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouse"] workhouses and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_psychiatric_institutions"] asylums for the mentally ill.
Keynesian economics
During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"] Great Depression, the definitive liberal response to the
economic crisis was given by the English economist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes"] John Maynard Keynes
(1883–1946). Keynes had been "brought up" as a classical liberal, but
especially after World War I became increasingly a welfare or social
liberal.[113] A prolific writer, among many other works, he had begun a
theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment,
money and prices back in the 1920s.[114] Keynes was deeply critical of the
British government's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity"] austerity measures [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_Kingdom"] during the Great Depression. He
believed that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_deficit"] budget deficits were a good thing, a product of recessions. He
wrote: "For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's
remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe
a slump as the present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a
standstill".[115] At the height of the Great Depression in 1933, Keynes
published The Means to Prosperity,  which contained specific policy
recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly
counter cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of
the first mentions of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_effect"] multiplier effect.[116] 
 John Maynard Keynes, one
of the most influential
economists of modern times
and whose ideas, which are
still [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Keynesian_resurgence"] widely felt, formalized
modern liberal economic
policy
Keynes's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece"] magnum opus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money"] The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,  was published in
1936[117] and served as a theoretical justification for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism"] interventionist policies Keynes favoured for
tackling a recession. The General Theory challenged the earlier [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-classical_economics"] neo-classical economic paradigm, which
had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)"] market would naturally establish
 full employment equilibrium. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economics"] Classical economists had believed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say%27s_law"] Say's law, which simply put states that
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_creates_its_own_demand"] supply creates its own demand" and that in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market"] free market workers would always be willing to lower their
wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the
concept of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_(economics)"] price stickiness, i.e. the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage
demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"] rational for them to do so. Due in part
to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand"] aggregate demand" and "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_supply"] aggregate supply"
may lead to stable unemployment equilibria and in those cases it is the state and not the market that
economies must depend on for their salvation. The book advocated activist economic policy by government
to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. In 1928, he
wrote: "Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth. [...] With men and plants
unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these
plants and these men that we shall afford them".[115] Where the market failed to properly allocate
resources, the government was required to stimulate the economy until private funds could start flowing
again—a "prime the pump" kind of strategy designed to boost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_production"] industrial production.[118]

Liberal feminist theory
 Liberal feminism, the dominant tradition in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_feminism"] feminist history, is an
 individualistic form of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_theory"] feminist theory which focuses on women's ability to
maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Liberal
feminists hope to eradicate all barriers to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality"] gender equality, claiming that the
continued existence of such barriers eviscerates the individual rights and
freedoms ostensibly guaranteed by a liberal social order.[119] They argue
 that society holds the false belief that women are by nature less
 intellectually and physically capable than men; thus it tends to discriminate
against women in the academy, the forum and the marketplace. Liberal
feminists believe that "female subordination is rooted in a set of customary
and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-
called public world". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal
reform.[120]
British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_women_philosophers"] philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft"] Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) is widely regarded as
the pioneer of liberal feminism, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman"] A Vindication of the Rights of Woman
(1792) expanding the boundaries of liberalism to include women in the
political structure of liberal society.[121] In her writings such as A
Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft commented on society's
view of the woman and encouraged women to use their voices in making
decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft
"denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure
giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages
that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What
Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood".[120] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"] Great Depression with
its periods of worldwide
economic hardship formed
the backdrop against which
 Keynesian Revolution took
 place (the image is Dorothea
Lange's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_Mother"] Migrant Mother
 depiction of destitute pea-
pickers in California, taken
in March 1936)
 John Stuart Mill was also an early proponent of feminism. In his article The
Subjection of Women (1861, published 1869), Mill attempted to prove that
the legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to
perfect equality.[122][123] He believed that both sexes should have equal
rights under the law and that "until conditions of equality exist, no one can
possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted
as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out
by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely".[124] Mill
frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to
feel the same "genuine unselfishness" that men did in providing for their 
 Mary Wollstonecraft, widely
regarded as the pioneer of
 liberal feminism
families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one "that motivates
people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family
unit".[120] Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their
husbands are often just as abusive as masters and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for
another human being. In his book The Subjection of Women, Mill argues that three major parts of women's
lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education and marriage.[125]
 Equity feminism is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s,[126][127] specifically a kind of
classically liberal or libertarian feminism.[128] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker"] Steven Pinker, an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychologist"] evolutionary psychologist, defines equity
feminism as "a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical
issues in psychology or biology".[129] Barry Kuhle asserts that equity feminism is compatible with
 evolutionary psychology in contrast to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Stole_Feminism%3F"] gender feminism.[130]

Social liberal theory
 Jean Charles Léonard Simonde de Sismondi's Nouveaux principes
d'économie politique, ou de la richesse dans ses rapports avec la
population (1819) represents the first comprehensive liberal critique of
early capitalism and laissez-faire economics, and his writings, which were
studied by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill"] John Stuart Mill and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx"] Karl Marx among many others, had a
profound influence on both liberal and socialist responses to the failures
and contradictions of industrial society.[131][132][133] By the end of the
19th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism#Evolution_of_core_beliefs"] principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly
challenged by downturns in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth"] economic growth, a growing perception of the
 evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within
modern industrial cities as well as the agitation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organised_labour"] organised labour. The Sismondi, who wrote the
ideal of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-made_man"] self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could first critique of the free
make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A  market from a liberal
major political reaction against the changes introduced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation"] industrialisation perspective in 1819
and laissez-faire capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social
balance, although [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism"] socialism later became a more important force for change
and reform. Some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_literature"] Victorian writers, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens"] Charles Dickens, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle"] Thomas Carlyle and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Arnold"] Matthew Arnold,
became early influential critics of social injustice.[134]
New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which
they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An
equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically
interfere with each other, or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied. More
 positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have an equal
opportunity of success.[135]
 John Stuart Mill contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining
elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the
new liberalism. Mill's 1859 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty"] On Liberty addressed the nature and limits of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"] power that can be legitimately exercised by society over the
individual.[136] He gave an impassioned defence of free speech, arguing
that free [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse"] discourse is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_condition"] necessary condition for intellectual and social
progress. Mill defined "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberty"] social liberty" as protection from "the tyranny of
political rulers". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form
tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority"] tyranny of the majority,
respectively. Social liberty meant limits on the ruler's power through
obtaining recognition of political liberties or rights and by the establishment
of a system of "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional"] constitutional checks".[137] 
 John Stuart Mill, whose On
His definition of liberty, influenced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley"] Joseph Priestley and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Warren"] Josiah Warren,
was that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual"] individual ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms
others.[138] However, although Mill's  initial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_and_economics"] economic philosophy 
Liberty greatly influenced
the course of 19th century
liberalism
supported [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market"] free markets and argued that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax"] progressive taxation penalised those
who worked harder,[139] he later altered his views toward a more socialist
bent, adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook and defending
some socialist causes,[140] including the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour
of a co-operative wage system.

Another early liberal convert to greater government intervention was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hill_Green"] Thomas Hill Green. Seeing the effects
of alcohol, he believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic
environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The
state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the
individual.[141] Green regarded the national state as legitimate only to the extent that it upholds a system of
rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation.
The New Liberalism or social liberalism movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.[142] The New Liberals,
which included intellectuals like L. T. Hobhouse and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson"] John A. Hobson, saw individual liberty as something
achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances.[143] In their view, the poverty, squalor
and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish.
New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action
coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state.[144] It supports a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy"] mixed economy that
includes both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_property"] public and private property in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_good"] capital goods.[145][146]
Principles that can be described as social liberal have been based upon or developed by philosophers such
 as John Stuart Mill, Eduard Bernstein, John Dewey, Carlo Rosselli, Norberto Bobbio and Chantal
Mouffe.[147] Other important social liberal figures include Guido Calogero, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Gobetti"] Piero Gobetti, Leonard
Trelawny Hobhouse and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._H._Tawney"] R. H. Tawney.[148] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_socialism"] Liberal socialism has been particularly prominent in British
and Italian politics.[148]
Anarcho-capitalist theory
 Classical liberalism advocates free trade under the rule of law. Anarcho-
capitalism goes one step further, with law enforcement and the courts being
provided by private companies. Various theorists have espoused legal
philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. One of the first liberals to
discuss the possibility of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatizing"] privatizing protection of individual liberty and
property was France's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Mauvillon"] Jakob Mauvillon in the 18th century. Later in the
1840s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Faucher"] Julius Faucher and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_de_Molinari"] Gustave de Molinari advocated the same. In his
essay The Production of Security, Molinari argued: "No government should
have the right to prevent another government from going into competition
with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this
commodity". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_de_Molinari"] Gustave de Molinari
reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and
libertarian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Raico"] Ralph Raico argues that what these liberal philosophers "had
come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be
called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism".[149] Unlike the
liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-
state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions
of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This
society versus state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs.
artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of
authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.[150]
The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued
after Molinari in the early writings of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer"] Herbert Spencer as well as in thinkers
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_%C3%89mile_de_Puydt"] Paul Émile de Puydt and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auberon_Herbert"] Auberon Herbert. However, the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Faucher"] Julius Faucher
person to use the term anarcho-capitalism was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard"] Murray Rothbard, who in
the mid-20th century synthesized elements from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School"] Austrian School of
economics, classical liberalism and 19th-century American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_anarchist"] individualist anarchists [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner"] Lysander Spooner and
 Benjamin Tucker (while rejecting their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value"] labor theory of value and the norms they derived from it).[151]
Page 14
 Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private
property and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_markets"] free markets. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute"] statute (law by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree"] decree or
legislation), society would improve itself through the discipline of the free market (or what its proponents
describe as a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_society"] voluntary society").[152][153]
In a theoretical anarcho-capitalist society, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement"] law enforcement, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"] courts and all other security services would be
operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through taxation. Money, along with all other
 goods and services, would be privately and competitively provided in an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_market"] open market. Anarcho-capitalists
say personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by victim-based dispute
resolution organizations under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort"] tort and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"] contract law, rather than by statute through centrally determined
punishment under what they describe as "political monopolies".[154] A Rothbardian anarcho-capitalist
society would operate under a mutually agreed-upon libertarian "legal code which would be generally
 accepted, and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow".[155] This pact would recognize self-
ownership and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle"] non-aggression principle (NAP), although methods of enforcement vary.
History
Isolated strands of liberal thought had existed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy"] Western philosophy since
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greeks"] Ancient Greeks and in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_philosophy"] Eastern philosophy since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty"] Song and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty"] Ming
period. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct
ideology, by the English philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"] John Locke, generally regarded as the
father of modern liberalism.[46][47][38][37] The first major signs of liberal
politics emerged in modern times. These ideas began to coalesce at the time
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War"] English Civil Wars. The Levellers, a radical political movement,
during the war called for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_the_United_Kingdom"] freedom of religion, frequent convening of
parliament and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily
increased during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_Britain"] 17th century in England, culminating in the Glorious
Revolution of 1688, which enshrined [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty"] parliamentary sovereignty and the
 right of revolution and led to the establishment of what many consider the
first modern, liberal state.[156] The development of liberalism continued
throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of
the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned
old traditions and influenced several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchies_in_Europe"] European monarchies throughout the 
 John Locke, who was the
first to develop a liberal
philosophy, including the
 right to private property and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed"] consent of the governed
18th century. Political tension between England and its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies"] American colonies
grew after 1765 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War"] Seven Years' War over the issue of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation"] taxation without representation, culminating in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"] Declaration of Independence of a new republic, and the resulting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War"] American Revolutionary War to
defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"] Articles of Confederation,
written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The
 Confederation Congress called a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention"] Constitutional Convention in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new
 Constitution of the United States establishing a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation"] federal government. In the context of the times, the
Constitution was a republican and liberal document.[157][158] It remains the oldest liberal governing
document in effect worldwide.
In Europe, liberalism has a long tradition dating back to the 17th century.[159] The French Revolution
 began in 1789. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the abolition of feudalism in
France on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and
privileges and restrictions as well as the passage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen"] Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen
in August.[160] During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars"] Napoleonic Wars, the French brought to Western Europe the liquidation of the
 feudal system, the liberalization of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_law"] property laws, the end of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism"] seigneurial dues, the abolition of guilds, the
legalization of divorce, the disintegration of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_in_Europe"] Jewish ghettos, the collapse of the Inquisition, the final end of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire"] Holy Roman Empire, the elimination of church courts and religious authority, the establishment of the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers"]
Page 15
 metric system and equality under the law for all men.[161] His most lasting
achievement, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_code"] Civil Code, served as "an object of emulation all over the
globe",[162] but it also perpetuated further discrimination against women
under the banner of the "natural order".[163]
The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and
 after the French Revolution in Britain.[80] Adam Smith's The Wealth of
Nations, published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics
at least until the publication of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill"] John Stuart Mill's Principles in 1848.[93]
Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices
Montesquieu, who argued
for the government's
 separation of powers 
and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow in
order to maximise wealth.[94] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalism_(historical)"] radical liberal movement began in the
1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform,
 emphasizing natural rights and popular sovereignty. Radicals like Richard
Price and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley"] Joseph Priestley saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward
 dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of Protestant
Dissenters, the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.[164]
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_and_conservatism_in_Latin_America"] Latin America, liberal unrest dates back to the 18th century, when liberal agitation in Latin America led
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_wars_of_independence"] independence from the imperial power of Spain and Portugal. The new regimes were generally liberal in
their political outlook and employed the philosophy of positivism, which emphasized the truth of modern
science, to buttress their positions.[165] In the United States, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] vicious war ensured the integrity of the
nation and the abolition of slavery in the South. Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] American Civil War (1861–1865) gave a major boost to the course of liberalism.[166]
During 19th and early 20th century in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, liberalism influenced periods
of reform such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat"] Tanzimat and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nahda"] Al-Nahda; the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism; and
 different intellectuals and religious group and movements, like the Young Ottomans and Islamic
Modernism. Prominent of the era were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifa%27a_al-Tahtawi"] Rifa'a al-Tahtawi, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam%C4%B1k_Kemal"] Namık Kemal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0brahim_%C5%9Einasi"] İbrahim Şinasi. However, the
reformist ideas and trends did not reach the common population successfully as the books, periodicals and
newspapers were accessible primarily to intellectuals and segments of an emerging middle class while
many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"] Muslims saw them as foreign influences on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_and_progressivism_in_the_Muslim_world"] world of Islam. That perception complicated reformist
efforts made by Middle Eastern states.[167][168] These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a
sense of crisis within Islam, which continues to this day. This led to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_revivalism"] Islamic revivalism.[169]
 Abolitionist and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage"] suffrage movements spread, along with
representative and democratic ideals. France established an
 enduring republic in the 1870s. However, nationalism also spread
rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in
 Italy and Germany brought about the unification of the two
countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power
in Italy and ended the secular power of the Popes. However, the
 Vatican launched a counter crusade against liberalism. Pope Pius
IX issued the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabus_of_Errors"] Syllabus of Errors in 1864, condemning liberalism in
all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by
 expelling the Jesuit order. By the end of the nineteenth century, the
principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged
and the ideal of the self-made individual seemed increasingly
 implausible. Victorian writers like Charles Dickens, Thomas
Carlyle and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Arnold"] Matthew Arnold were early influential critics of social
injustice.[134]

Liberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The
bastion of autocracy, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II"] Russian Tsar, was overthrown in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution"] first phase of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution"] Russian Revolution. The Allied victory in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War"] First World War and the
collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across
the European continent, not just among the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I"] victorious allies, but also in
Germany and the newly created states of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"] Eastern Europe. Militarism, as
typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Blinkhorn argues,
the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious
and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free market economics,
representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the
peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the
 League of Nations".
In the Middle East, liberalism led to constitutional periods, like the Ottoman
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Constitutional_Era_(Ottoman_Empire)"] First and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Era_(Ottoman_Empire)"] Second Constitutional Era and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Constitutional_Revolution"] Persian constitutional period,
but it declined in the late 1930s due to the growth and opposition of
 Islamism and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Arabism"] pan-Arab nationalism.[176] However, there were various
examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas.
 Prominent liberals during the period were Taha Hussein, Ahmed Lutfi el-
 Sayed, Tawfiq al-Hakim, Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri and Muhammad
Mandur.[177] 
As a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_nationalist"] liberal nationalist,[170]
 K. J. Ståhlberg (1865–1952),
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Finland"] President of Finland,
 anchored the state in liberal
democracy, guarded the
 fragile germ of the rule of
law, and embarked on
internal reforms.[171]
In the United States, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States"] modern liberalism
traces its history to the popular presidency
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt"] Franklin D. Roosevelt, who initiated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal"] New Deal in response to the
 Great Depression and won an unprecedented four elections. The New Deal
coalition established by Roosevelt left a decisive legacy and influenced
many future American presidents, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy"] John F. Kennedy.[178]
Meanwhile, the definitive liberal response to the Great Depression was
given by the British economist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes"] John Maynard Keynes, who had begun a
theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment,
money and prices back in the 1920s.[179] The worldwide Great
Depression, starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics
January 1933 color photo of
 Franklin D. Roosevelt as the
 Man of the Year of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"] Time 
and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic
woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading
to the rise of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism"] fascism as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both
liberalism and communism, especially in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany"] Nazi Germany and Italy.[180] The
rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"] World War II, the
deadliest conflict in human history. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II"] Allies prevailed in the war by 1945 and their victory set the stage
for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War"] Cold War between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state"] Communist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc"] Eastern Bloc and the liberal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc"] Western Bloc.
 In Iran, liberalism enjoyed wide popularity. In April 1951, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(Iran)"] National Front became the governing
coalition when democratically elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh"] Mohammad Mosaddegh, a liberal nationalist, took office as the
 Prime Minister. However, his way of governing entered in conflict with Western interest and he was
removed from power in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] coup on 19 August 1953. The coup ended the dominance of liberalism in the
country's politics.[186]
Among the various regional and national movements, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement"] civil rights movement in the United States during
the 1960s strongly highlighted the liberal efforts for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_equality"] equal rights.[187] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society"] Great Society project launched
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"] President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson"] Lyndon B. Johnson oversaw the creation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"] Medicare and Medicaid, the establishment of
 Head Start and the Job Corps as part of the War on Poverty and the passage of the landmark Civil Rights
Act of 1964, an altogether rapid series of events that some historians have dubbed the "Liberal Hour".[188]
Page 17
The Cold War featured extensive ideological competition and
several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war"] proxy wars, but the widely feared [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III"] World War III between
the Soviet Union and the United States never occurred. While
communist states and liberal democracies competed against one
another, an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis"] economic crisis in the 1970s inspired a move away
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics"] Keynesian economics, especially under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher"] Margaret Thatcher in
the United Kingdom and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan"] Ronald Reagan in the United States. This
trend, known as neoliberalism, constituted a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift"] paradigm shift away
from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-war_Keynesian_consensus"] post-war Keynesian consensus which had lasted from
1945 to 1980.[189][190] Meanwhile, nearing the end of the 20th
 century, communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed
precipitously, leaving liberal democracies as the only major forms
of government in the West. 
 2017 Russian protests were
organized by Russia's liberal
opposition
At the beginning of World War II, the number of democracies around the world was about the same as it
had been forty years before.[191] After 1945, liberal democracies spread very quickly, but then retreated. In
The Spirit of Democracy, Larry Diamond argues that by 1974 "dictatorship, not democracy, was the way
of the world" and that "barely a quarter of independent states chose their governments through competitive,
free, and fair elections". Diamond goes on to say that democracy bounced back and by 1995 the world was
"predominantly democratic".[192][193]
Criticism and support
Liberalism has drawn both criticism and support in its history from
various ideological groups. Less friendly to the goals of liberalism
has been conservatism. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke"] Edmund Burke, considered by some to be
the first major proponent of modern conservative thought, offered a
blistering critique of the French Revolution by assailing the liberal
pretensions to the power of rationality and to the natural equality of
all humans.[194]
Some confusion remains about the relationship between social
liberalism and socialism, despite the fact that many variants of
socialism distinguish themselves markedly from liberalism by
 opposing capitalism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"] hierarchy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property"] private property. Socialism
formed as a group of related yet divergent ideologies in the 19th 
 Execution of José María de Torrijos
y Uriarte and his men in 1831 as

century such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_socialism"] Christian socialism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism"] communism (with the writings
 of Karl Marx) and social anarchism (with the writings of Mikhail
Bakunin), the latter two influenced by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune"] Paris Commune. These ideologies—as with liberalism and
conservatism—fractured into several major and minor movements in the following decades.[195] Marx
rejected the foundational aspects of liberal theory, hoping to destroy both the state and the liberal distinction
between society and the individual while fusing the two into a collective whole designed to overthrow the
developing capitalist order of the 19th century.[196] Today, socialist parties and ideas remain a political
force with varying degrees of power and influence on all continents leading national governments in many
countries.
 Vladimir Lenin stated that—in contrast with Marxism—liberal science defends [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery"] wage slavery.[197][198]
However, some proponents of liberalism like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Henry_Evans"] George Henry Evans, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Gesell"] Silvio Gesell and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine"] Thomas Paine were
 critics of wage slavery.[199][200] One of the most outspoken critics of liberalism was the Roman Catholic
Church,[201] which resulted in lengthy power struggles between national governments and the Church. In
the same vein, conservatives have also attacked what they perceive to be the reckless liberal pursuit of
Page 18
progress and material gains, arguing that such preoccupations undermine
traditional social values rooted in community and continuity.[202] However,
a few variations of conservatism, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_conservatism"] liberal conservatism, expound some
of the same ideas and principles championed by classical liberalism,
including "small government and thriving capitalism".[194]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy"] Social democracy, an ideology advocating progressive modification of
capitalism, emerged in the 20th century and was influenced by socialism.
Broadly defined as a project that aims to correct through government
reformism what it regards as the intrinsic defects of capitalism by reducing
inequalities,[203] social democracy was also not against the state. Several
commentators have noted strong similarities between social liberalism and
social democracy, with one political scientist even calling American 
 Raif Badawi, a Saudi
Arabian writer and the
creator of the website Free
liberalism "bootleg social democracy" due to the absence of a significant Saudi Liberals, who was
social democratic tradition in the United States that liberals have tried to
rectify.[204] Another movement associated with modern democracy, 
sentenced to ten years in
prison and 1,000 lashes for
 Christian democracy, hopes to spread [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_social_teaching"] Catholic social ideas and has gained
a large following in some European nations.[205] The early roots of 
"insulting Islam" in 2014
Christian democracy developed as a reaction against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation"] industrialisation
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanisation"] urbanisation associated with laissez-faire liberalism in the 19th century.[206] Despite these complex
relationships, some scholars have argued that liberalism actually "rejects ideological thinking" altogether,
largely because such thinking could lead to unrealistic expectations for human society.[207]
 Fascists accuse liberalism of materialism and a lack of spiritual values.[208] In particular, fascism opposes
liberalism for its materialism, rationalism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism"] individualism and utilitarianism.[209] Fascists believe that the
liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness,[208] but many fascists agree with
liberals in their support of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property_rights"] private property rights and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy"] market economy.[209]
 Leftists accuse the economic doctrines of liberalism, such as economic individual freedom, of giving rise to
 what they view as a system of exploitation that goes against democratic principles of liberalism.[210] Right-
wingers accuse the social doctrines of liberalism, such as secularism and individual rights, of breaking
down communities and dissolving the social fabric that they believe a country needs to prosper.[210]
Scholars have praised the influence of liberal internationalism, claiming that the rise of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalisation"] globalisation
"constitutes a triumph of the liberal vision that first appeared in the eighteenth century" while also writing
that liberalism is "the only comprehensive and hopeful vision of world affairs".[211]
According to Russian President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin"] Vladimir Putin, as reported in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times"] Financial Times, "liberalism has become
obsolete". He claims that the vast majority of people in the world oppose multiculturalism, immigration, and
rights for people who are LGBT.[212]

liberalism, to liberty and guarantees of liberty. The two may agree; they are not contradictory,
but they are neither identical, nor necessarily connected. In the moral order, liberalism is the
liberty to think, recognised and practiced. This is primordial liberalism, as the liberty to think
is itself the first and noblest of liberties. Man would not be free in any degree or in any
sphere of action, if he were not a thinking being endowed with consciousness. The freedom
of worship, the freedom of education, and the freedom of the press are derived the most
directly from the freedom to think."

"Liberalism, liberal values and liberal institutions formed an integral part of that process of
European consolidation. Fifteen years after the end of the Second World War, the liberal and
democratic identity of Western Europe had been reinforced on almost all sides by the
definition of the West as a place of freedom. Set against the oppression in the Communist
East, by the slow development of a greater understanding of the moral horror of Nazism, and
by the engagement of intellectuals and others with the new states (and social and political
systems) emerging in the non-European world to the South"
