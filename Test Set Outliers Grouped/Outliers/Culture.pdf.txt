Culture
Culture ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈkʌltʃər/) is an umbrella term which encompasses the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior"] social behavior, institutions, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm"] norms
found in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"] human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit"] habits of
the individuals in these groups.[1] Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or
location.
Humans acquire culture through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"] learning processes of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enculturation"] enculturation and socialization, which is shown
by the diversity of cultures across societies.
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_norm"] cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress,
language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.
Accepting only a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculturalism"] monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face
of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.[2] Thus in military culture, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage"] valor is
counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as
virtues or functional responses in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_of_conflict"] continuum of conflict. In the practice of religion, analogous attributes
can be identified in a social group.
Cultural change, or repositioning, is the reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society.[3] Cultures are
internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. Cultures are externally
affected via contact between societies.

Description
Culture is considered a central concept in anthropology,
encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted
through social [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"] learning in human societies. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universals"] Cultural universals are
found in all human societies. These include expressive forms like
 art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool
 usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material
culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as
technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects
of culture such as principles of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_organization"] social organization (including
practices of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_organization"] political organization and social institutions),
mythology, philosophy, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"] literature (both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing"] written and oral), and

In the humanities, one sense of culture as an attribute of the
individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a
particular level of sophistication in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts"] the arts, sciences, education,
or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also
sometimes been used to distinguish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization"] civilizations from less
complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are
also found in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"] class-based distinctions between a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture"] high culture of
the social [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"] elite and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_culture"] low culture, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture"] popular culture, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_culture"] folk culture
of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to
 cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer
specifically to the symbolic markers used by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity"] ethnic groups to
 distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as body
 modification, clothing or jewelry. Mass culture refers to the mass-
produced and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"] mass mediated forms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_culture"] consumer culture that
emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as 
 Religion and expressive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"] art are

 Marxism and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory"] critical theory, have argued that culture is often
used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat"] proletariat
and create a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consciousness"] false consciousness. Such perspectives are common
in the discipline of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies"] cultural studies. In the wider [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"] social sciences,
the theoretical perspective of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_materialism_(cultural_studies)"] cultural materialism holds that
human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of
human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival,
and that the basis of culture is found in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution"] evolved biological

traditions, and values of a society or community, such as an
ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"] multiculturalism
values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet.
Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture"] subculture
(e.g. "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bro_culture"] bro culture"), or a counterculture. Within [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology"] cultural anthropology, the ideology and analytical stance of
 cultural relativism hold that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any
Page 3
evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given
culture.
Etymology
 The modern term "culture" is based on a term used by the ancient
Roman orator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero"] Cicero in his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusculanae_Disputationes"] Tusculanae Disputationes, where he
wrote of a cultivation of the soul or "cultura animi,"[6] using an
 agricultural [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor"] metaphor for the development of a philosophical soul,
understood [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology"] teleologically as the highest possible ideal for human
development. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Pufendorf"] Samuel Pufendorf took over this metaphor in a
modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer
assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use,
and that of many writers after him, "refers to all the ways in which
human beings overcome their original barbarism, and through
artifice, become fully human."[7]
In 1986, philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_S._Casey"] Edward S. Casey wrote, "The very word
culture meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word
goes back to Latin colere, 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and
cultus, 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a
culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensely to cultivate it—to
be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."[8]
Culture described by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Velkley"] Richard Velkley:[7] 
 Pygmy music has been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphonic_music"] polyphonic
well before their discovery by non-
African explorers of the Baka, Aka,
Efe, and other foragers of the Central
African forests, in the 1200s, which
is at least 200 years before
polyphony developed in Europe. Note
the multiple lines of singers and
dancers. The motifs are independent,
with theme and variation
interweaving.[4] This type of music is
thought to be the first expression of
polyphony in world music.
... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern
meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels
developing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousseau"] Rousseau's criticism of "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity"] modern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"] liberalism and Enlightenment." Thus a contrast
between "culture" and "civilization" is usually implied in these authors, even when not
expressed as such.
In the words of anthropologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Burnett_Tylor"] E.B. Tylor, it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art,
morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."[9]
Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the
practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities
of social meaning of a life held in common.[10]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Advanced_Learner%27s_Dictionary"] Cambridge English Dictionary states that culture is "the way of life, especially the general customs
and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time."[11] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory"] Terror management theory posits that
culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the basis for perceiving themselves
as "person[s] of worth within the world of meaning"—raising themselves above the merely physical
aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that Homo sapiens became aware
of when they acquired a larger brain.[12][13]
The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with
 symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral
modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago and is often thought to be unique to humans. However,

some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complicated, abilities for social learning. It
is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that are
transmitted through social [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"] interaction and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.
Change
It has been estimated from archaeological data that the human
capacity for cumulative culture emerged somewhere between
500,000–170,000 years ago.[14]
 Raimon Panikkar identified 29 ways in which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_change"] cultural change can
be brought about, including growth, development, evolution,
involution, renovation, reconception, reform, innovation,
revivalism, revolution, mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis,
borrowing, eclecticism, syncretism, modernization, indigenization,
and transformation.[15] In this context, modernization could be
viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such
as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the
 notion of progress. Rein Raud, building on the work of Umberto
Eco, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu"] Pierre Bourdieu and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_C._Alexander"] Jeffrey C. Alexander, has proposed a
model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are
judged by their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_adequacy"] cognitive adequacy and endorsed or not endorsed
by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question.[16] 
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles"] The Beatles exemplified changing
cultural dynamics, not only in music,
but fashion and lifestyle. Over a half
century after their emergence, they
 continue to have a worldwide cultural
impact.

explosion, among other factors.
 Culture repositioning means the

concept of a society.[17]

Cultures are internally affected by
both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These
forces are related to both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure"] social structures and natural events, and
are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices
within [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuration"] current structures, which themselves are subject to
Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social
dynamics and promoting new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)"] cultural models, and spurring or enabling [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_actor"] generative action. These social
 shifts may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. feminist
movement involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and
Page 5
economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as
factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the
last [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age"] ice age, plants suitable for domestication were available,
leading to the invention of agriculture, which in turn brought about
many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.[19]
Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies,
which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in
cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact
technological development or social dynamics. Additionally,
cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through
diffusion or acculturation. In diffusion, the form of something
(though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to
another. For example, Western restaurant chains and culinary
brands sparked curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China
opened its economy to international trade in the late 20th-

century.[20] "Stimulus diffusion" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an
element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the other
 hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. Diffusion of
innovations theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new
ideas, practices, and products.[21]
 Acculturation has different meanings. Still, in this context, it refers to the replacement of traits of one culture
with another, such as what happened to certain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"] Native American tribes and many indigenous peoples
across the globe during the process of colonization. Related processes on an individual level include
 assimilation (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and transculturation. The transnational flow of
culture has played a major role in merging different cultures and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.
Early modern discourses
German Romanticism
 Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of
"enlightenment" similar to the concept of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildung"] bildung: "Enlightenment is man's
emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."[22] He argued that this
immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of
courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant
urged: "Sapere Aude" ("Dare to be wise!"). In reaction to Kant, German
scholars such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottfried_Herder"] Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) argued that human
creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms,
is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a
collective form of Bildung: "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of
experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny,
to a people."[23] 
 Johann Herder called
In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt"] Wilhelm von Humboldt

Herder's interests. During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism"] Romantic era, scholars in Germany,
especially those concerned with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"] nationalist movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a
"Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the

 Austro-Hungarian Empire—developed a more inclusive notion of culture
as "worldview" (Weltanschauung).[24] According to this school of thought,
each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with
the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier
views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between
"civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.
In 1860, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Bastian"] Adolf Bastian (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of
mankind."[25] He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human
societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic
elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of
"elementary ideas" (Elementargedanken); different cultures, or different
"folk ideas" (Völkergedanken), are local modifications of the elementary
ideas.[26] This view paved the way for the modern understanding of
culture. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas"] Franz Boas (1858–1942) was trained in this tradition, and he
brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.[27]
English Romanticism
British poet and critic
 Matthew Arnold viewed
"culture" as the cultivation
of the humanist ideal. 
 In the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist Matthew
Arnold (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of
individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in
the world."[28] This concept of culture is also comparable to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_people"] German
concept of bildung: "...culture being a pursuit of our total [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection"] perfection by
means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the
best which has been thought and said in the world."[28]
In practice, culture referred to an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"] elite ideal and was associated with such
activities as art, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music"] classical music, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_cuisine"] haute cuisine.[29] As these forms were
associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from
Latin: civitas, lit. 'city'). Another facet of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism"] Romantic movement was an
interest in folklore, which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites.
This distinction is often characterized as that between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture"] high culture, namely
that of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_class"] ruling [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"] social group, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_culture"] low culture. In other words, the idea of
"culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries
reflected inequalities within European societies.[30]
 Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with anarchy; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas
Hobbes and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau"] Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature." According to Hobbes
and Rousseau, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"] Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on
were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and
"uncivilized."[31] According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more
civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer"] Herbert Spencer's
theory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism"] Social Darwinism and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Henry_Morgan"] Lewis Henry Morgan's theory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_evolution"] cultural evolution. Just as some critics
have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is an expression of the conflict between
European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and
uncivilized people is an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial
subjects.
Page 7
Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this
differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the
refinement and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophistication"] sophistication of high culture as corrupting and unnatural
developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature. These
critics considered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music"] folk music (as produced by "the folk," i.e., rural, illiterate,
peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music
seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed
 indigenous peoples as "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage"] noble savages" living [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_(philosophy)"] authentic and unblemished
lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism"] capitalist
systems of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"] the West.
In 1870 the anthropologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Burnett_Tylor"] Edward Tylor (1832–1917) applied these ideas
 of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of
religion. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic
to more monotheistic forms.[32] In the process, he redefined culture as a
diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view
paved the way for the modern understanding of religion.
Anthropology 
British anthropologist
 Edward Tylor was one of the
first English-speaking
scholars to use the term
culture in an inclusive and
universal sense.
Although anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor's  definition of
culture,[33] in the 20th century "culture" emerged as the central and
unifying concept of American anthropology, where it most commonly
refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human
 experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded
experiences socially.[34] American anthropology is organized into four
fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture:
 biological anthropology, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_anthropology"] linguistic anthropology, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology"] cultural anthropology,
and in the United States and Canada, archaeology.[35][36][37][38] The term
Kulturbrille,  or "culture glasses,"  coined by German American
anthropologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas"] Franz Boas, refers to the "lenses" through which a person
sees their own culture. Martin Lindstrom asserts that Kulturbrille, which
allow a person to make sense of the culture they inhabit, "can blind us to
things outsiders pick up immediately."[39]

Sociology
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology_of_culture"] sociology of culture concerns culture as manifested in society. For sociologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Simmel"] Georg Simmel (1858–
1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have
been objectified in the course of history."[40] As such, culture in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology"] sociological field can be defined as the
ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life.
Culture can be either of two types, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-material_culture"] non-material culture or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_culture"] material culture.[5] Non-material culture refers to
the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules,
norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a
culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in
archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be
attributed to culture, past or present.
Page 8
Cultural sociology first emerged in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic"] Weimar Germany
(1918–1933), where sociologists such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Weber"] Alfred Weber
used the term Kultursoziologie ('cultural sociology').
Cultural sociology was then reinvented in the English-
speaking world as a product of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_turn"] cultural turn of the
1960s, which ushered in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(sociology)"] structuralist and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_philosophy"] postmodern
approaches to social science. This type of cultural
sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach
incorporating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_analysis"] cultural analysis and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory"] critical theory.
Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods,
instead [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics"] hermeneutically focusing on words, artifacts
and symbols.[41] Culture has since become an An example of folkloric dancing in Colombia.
important concept across many branches of sociology,
 including resolutely scientific fields like social
stratification and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"] social network analysis. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative
sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly,
not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and
 instead, look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of social psychology and cognitive
science. [42]
Early researchers and development of cultural
sociology
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between
sociology (as shaped by early theorists like Marx,[43] Durkheim,
and Weber) with the growing discipline of anthropology, wherein
researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and
analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy
of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much
of cultural, sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a
variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current
research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For
instance, relationships between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture"] popular culture, political control,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"] social class were early and lasting concerns in the field.
Cultural studies

In the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced
 by Marxism such as Stuart Hall (1932–2014) and Raymond Williams (1921–1988) developed cultural
studies. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified culture with consumption goods and
leisure activities (such as art, music, film, food, sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption
and leisure as determined by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_of_production"] relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the
organization of production.[44][45]
In the United Kingdom, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture"] popular culture; that is, on the social
meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hoggart"] Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when
he founded the Birmingham [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Contemporary_Cultural_Studies"] Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS.[46] It has since become
strongly associated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hall_(cultural_theorist)"] Stuart Hall,[47] who succeeded Hoggart as Director.[48] Cultural studies in this
sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which
belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"] Western civilization or globalism.

From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with
that of his colleagues [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Willis_(cultural_theorist)"] Paul Willis, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Hebdige"] Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_McRobbie"] Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual
 movement. As the field developed, it began to combine political
economy, communication, sociology, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_theory"] social theory, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_theory"] literary theory,
 media theory, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_theory"] film/video studies, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology"] cultural anthropology, philosophy,
 museum studies, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_history"] art history to study cultural phenomena or
cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how
particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality,
ethnicity, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"] social class, and/or gender.[49] Cultural studies is  The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art"] Metropolitan Museum of Art in

practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as

watching [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"] television or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies
the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and
practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason.
Watching television to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture
unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however,
schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to "fit in" certainly qualifies since there is
no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.
In the context of cultural studies, a text includes not only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_language"] written language, but also films, photographs,
 fashion or hairstyles: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.[50]
Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of culture. Culture, for a cultural-studies researcher, not only
includes traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture"] high culture (the culture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_class"] ruling [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"] social groups)[51] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture"] popular culture, but also
everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A
 further and recent approach is comparative cultural studies, based on the disciplines of comparative
literature and cultural studies.[52]
Scholars in the United Kingdom and the United States developed somewhat different versions of cultural
studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s,
mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.P._Thompson"] E.P. Thompson, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Williams"] Raymond Williams, and later that of
Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Birmingham"] University of Birmingham.
 This included overtly political, left-wing views, and criticisms of popular culture as "capitalist" mass
culture; it absorbed some of the ideas of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School"] Frankfurt School critique of the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry"] culture industry" (i.e. mass
culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the
work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gilroy"] Paul Gilroy.
In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-
pluralist tradition."[53] The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with
understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_culture"] mass culture; for
example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom. The distinction
between American and British strands, however, has faded. Some researchers, especially in early British
cultural studies, apply a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist"] Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the
 Frankfurt School, but especially from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism"] structuralist Marxism of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Althusser"] Louis Althusser and others. The main
focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a
mass production of culture and identifies [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)"] power as residing with those producing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_artifact"] cultural artifacts. In a
Marxist view, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production"] mode and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_of_production"] relations of production form the economic base of society, which constantly
interacts and influences superstructures, such as culture.[54] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as
 feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view.
They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural
product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the
meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the
Page 10
Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.),[55] which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce
commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art
historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griselda_Pollock"] Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_history"] art history and psychoanalysis.
The writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Kristeva"] Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural
studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_feminism"] French feminism.[56]
Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:[57]
1. The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency orientation" of the societies:
performance orientation, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_orientation"] future orientation, assertiveness, power distance, and uncertainty
avoidance.
2. The second covers the variables that represent the "social orientation" of societies, i.e., the
attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism,
institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, and human orientation.
In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rein_Raud"] Rein Raud,[16] who defines culture as the sum of
resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach,
combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable
actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of purposes), thus making it possible to
re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.
Psychology
Starting in the 1990s,[58]: 31  psychological research on culture
influence began to grow and challenge the universality assumed in
general psychology.[59]: 158–168 [60] Culture psychologists began to
try to explore the relationship between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotions_and_culture"] emotions and culture, and
answer whether the human mind is independent from culture. For
example, people from collectivistic cultures, such as the Japanese,
suppress their positive emotions more than their American
counterparts.[61] Culture may affect the way that people experience
and express emotions. On the other hand, some researchers try to
 look for differences between people's  personalities across
cultures.[62][63] As different cultures dictate distinctive norms,
 culture shock is also studied to understand how people react when
they are confronted with other cultures. Cognitive tools may not be
accessible or they may function differently cross culture.[58]: 19  For 
Cognitive tools suggest a way for
people from certain culture to deal
with real-life problems, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suanpan"] Suanpan
for Chinese to perform mathematical
calculation
example, people who are raised in a culture with an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus"] abacus are
trained with distinctive reasoning style.[64] Cultural lenses may also make people view the same outcome of
events differently. Westerners are more motivated by their successes than their failures, while East Asians
are better motivated by the avoidance of failure.[65] Culture is important for psychologists to consider when
understanding the human mental operation.
Protection of culture
There are a number of international agreements and national laws relating to the protection of culture and
 cultural heritage. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO"] UNESCO and its partner organizations such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Shield_International"] Blue Shield International coordinate
international protection and local implementation.[66][67]Basically, the Hague Convention for the
Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the UNESCO Convention for the
Protection of Cultural Diversity deal with the protection of culture. Article 27 of the Universal Declaration
Page 11
of Human Rights deals with cultural heritage in two ways: it gives
people the right to participate in cultural life on the one hand and
the right to the protection of their contributions to cultural life on
the other.[68]
The protection of culture and cultural goods is increasingly taking
up a large area nationally and internationally. Under international
law, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN"] UN and UNESCO try to set up and enforce rules for this.
The aim is not to protect a person's property, but rather to preserve
the cultural heritage of humanity, especially in the event of war and
armed conflict. According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Habsburg"] Karl von Habsburg, President of Blue
Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also part of
psychological warfare. The target of the attack is the identity of the
opponent, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main

target. It is also intended to affect the particularly sensitive cultural
memory, the growing cultural diversity and the economic basis (such as tourism) of a state, region or
municipality.[69][70][71]
Another important issue today is the impact of tourism on the various forms of culture. On the one hand,
this can be physical impact on individual objects or the destruction caused by increasing environmental
pollution and, on the other hand, socio-cultural effects on society.[72][73][74]
