Proposed Manager: Keith Masse Proposed Assistant Manager: John Ryall
Department Comments/Statuses
Approved: Treasurer/Collector
Inspectional Services: 1. Framingham Inspectional Services rescinds previous non-opposition to
the issuance of the common victualer and liquor license for 120 Worcester Road. Framingham
Inspectional Services opposes the issuance of the common victualer and liquor licenses at 120
Worcester Road. 
2. The latest submission of plans to Ed Clinton, City of Framingham Plans Examiner, received
May 24th, 2021, does not detail a revised occupant load. Plan “T1-00 title sheet” is the original
plan detailing occupant loads lower than the occupant loads proposed on the common victualer
and liquor license applications. 
3. Framingham Inspectional Services shall reconsider opposition to the issuance of the licenses
with the submission of revised construction documents during the building permit application
process. 
4. The building permit for this structure has yet to be issued, and ground has not been broken to
start construction. It should be noted that the original building permit application for this
proposal was submitted on February 3rd, 2020, and efforts to obtain the building permit remain
on-going. Due to changes in the design, and the possibility of occupant loads having to be
modified to comply with building code, zoning, and other factors beyond the control of the
applicant and this Department, Framingham Inspectional Services reserves the right to rescind
any determination made for this proposed restaurant in regards to licensing requirements. 
Health Department—Reviewing revised floor plan and pending issuance of food permit pending.

Hi Diane, 
 
I’ve received the updated plans from my client! I’ve attached them, and also an updated section 3 of the application 
with the new seating amount (289 instead of 283 ‐ 245 inside and 44 at the Patio).

Hi Mariel; 
Were you able to get an answer from your client about an updated floor plan? I spoke to the Health 
Department Inspector who also received updated floor plans. The outstanding question is whether new plans 
differ from the floor, site and egress furnishing plans (as it contains actual seating tabulation) dated Jan. 20, 
2020 which were submitted with the liquor and cv license applications.

By virtue of the authority contained in Chapter 138 of the Massachusetts General Laws
(“Chapter 138”), and Article V, Section 1 of the City of Framingham General Ordinances (the
“Ordinances”), the Board of License Commissioners of the City of Framingham, serving as the City’s
Liquor Licensing Authority (the “Board”) hereby promulgates these Rules and Regulations Governing
Alcoholic Beverages (“Regulations”). The Regulations shall supersede all previous regulations or
policies issued by the City of Framingham (the “City”), or, collectively as the preceding licensing
authority, the Town of Framingham and/or Board of Selectmen . The Board has the power under the
Ordinances and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to amend these Regulations
periodically from time to time as it sees fit. For the purposes hereof, the Regulations, Ordinances, and
Chapter 138 shall be collectively referred to as the “Laws”.
Any license issued for the sale in any manner of any alcoholic beverages (a “License”) shall be
issued on the condition of full compliance with these Regulations. The failure to comply with the Laws
and other Ordinances or rules issued by the City and/or the Board shall constitute sufficient cause or
grounds for refusing to grant the license, or for suspending, canceling, modifying, or revoking such
license or permit already granted, in accordance with Article XV herein. Any individual, organization, 
or company licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to herein as a “Licensee”.
Any premises licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to as the “Licensed
Premises”.

Public consumption of alcoholic beverages as defined in Chapter 138, Section 1 is permitted
only in accordance with an appropriate License issued by the Board. Absent an appropriate License
issued by the Board, it is prohibited to drink any alcoholic beverage while on, in or upon any public
way or upon any way to which the public has a right of access; any place to which members of the
public have access as invitees or licensees; a park or playground. It is prohibited to drink any alcoholic
beverage while on, in or upon or private land or place without consent of the owner or person in control
thereof. All alcoholic beverages used in violation of this shall be seized and safely held until final

require all employees engaged in serving alcoholic beverages and/or viewing of
identification cards to obtain Alcohol Training Program certification within thirty (30) 
days of employment and the Manager shall maintain a list of employee certifications. 
To the extent an employee serves alcohol or views identification cards prior to
obtaining Alcohol Training Program certification, the Manager of Record, as defined

employee, and any violation of these regulations committed by the employee will be
treated as if the Manager and/or Licensee had committed the violation. Managers and
Assistant Managers shall obtain Alcohol Training Program certification prior to
assuming the duties of Manager or Assistant Manager. The Licensee shall strongly
encourage all alcohol servers to attend periodic retraining programs at least bi-annually
that reinforce the certification training described herein. Records of retraining may be

attend said hearing may result in the revocation of the Manager or Assistant Manager’s
ID Card by the Framingham Police Department. Violation of this section shall further
subject Licensees and management to penalties under Article XV as may be imposed
by the Board.

proposal and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant should request to be placed
on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the hearing in accordance with
Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the application for a License and
the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then consider the application and

each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The Licensee shall sign a receipt to be
maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these Regulations.

Page 370
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer:
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
particular License application: 
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license. [Comment: I’m
capitalizing “Veteran” in accordance with DoD style. This is purely a stylistic choice.]
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that
offers a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work. 
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application.
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location.
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the
City of Framingham.
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section
12, the applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic
beverages (or beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft
sodas, teas, kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional
non-alcoholic beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or
high-density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the
applicant’s proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises
presently located in the area.
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without
the prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall
be considered a change in location or number of seatsing, location of bar, addition or reduction in
square footage, or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of
Framingham. 
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany
each application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location
shall be processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant
such transfer requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon
the proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the
following: receipts showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and
withheld federal and state income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court-
appointed receivers, or to assignees for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession
of the Licensed Premises by, through or under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights
to the license or the renewal or transfer of such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona
fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in the application as holding such interest shall be treated
Page 9 of 23 
Page 371
in the same manner as the original majority ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for
any transfers of ownership or location, including, but not limited to transfers to mortgagees. 
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance
of their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing
Department and online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These
Regulations shall be appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick
up his/her annual license until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these
Regulations has been received. A copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the
Licensed Premises at all times and shall be available for inspection upon request. 
XI. Filing Fees and Annual Licensing Fees

and License terms. This Article XV is intended to empower the Board to consider the circumstances of
each case and provide a mechanism by which Licensees can improve their compliance with the Lawsse
Regulations in the future.

VI. Procedure for Obtaining Liquor Licenses
The applicant for a License of any type should submit a letter to the Board outlining the
proposal and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant should request to be placed
on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the hearing in accordance with
Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the application for a License and
the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then consider the application and
respond in a timely manner to the applicant. The Board shall provide a copy of these Regulations to
each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The Licensee shall sign a receipt to be
maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these Regulations. 
Pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 15A, where there are no premises actually in existence at the
time the application for a License is made, the applicant shall file a plan showing the actual dimensions
of premises which are to be constructed on which the License is to be exercised. A License granted
under this provision shall be upon the condition that such License shall not be issued until completion
of the Licensed Premises in accordance with the plan, and the decision of the Board as to whether the
plan has been complied with shall be final. The Board may include as a condition of such License that
the Licensed Premises be completed in accordance with the plan by a date certain or the License shall
be deemed null and void. Said specified completion date may be extended by the Board in its sole
discretion upon written request by the applicant submitted to the Board at least 45 days prior to the
expiration of the initial anticipated completion date as stated in the License. 
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer: 
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
particular License application: 
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license. 
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that
offers a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work. 
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application. 
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location. 
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the
Page 8 of 21 
Page 393
City of Framingham. 
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section
12, the applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic
beverages (or beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft
sodas, teas, kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional
non-alcoholic beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or
high-density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the
applicant’s proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises
presently located in the area. 
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without
the prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall
be considered a change in location or number of seats, location of bar, addition or reduction in square
footage, or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham. 
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany
each application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location
shall be processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant
such transfer requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon
the proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the
following: receipts showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and
withheld federal and state income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court-
appointed receivers, or to assignees for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession
of the Licensed Premises by, through or under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights
to the license or the renewal or transfer of such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona
fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in the application as holding such interest shall be treated
in the same manner as the original majority ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for
any transfers of ownership or location, including, but not limited to transfers to mortgagees. 
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance
of their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing
Department and online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These
Regulations shall be appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick
up his/her annual license until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these
Regulations has been received. A copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the
Licensed Premises at all times and shall be available for inspection upon request.

States or by a government of a foreign country recognized by the United States

XV. Penalties, Procedure and Structure for Violations of the Ordinance and Regulations
A.  Purpose
The purpose of this penalty structure is to improve the ability of the Board to prevent alcohol
abuse and violation of the Laws. This Article XV will help to achieve reasonable uniformity in the
imposition of penalties and to avoid confusion in the minds of the public, patrons, and Licensees due to
a lack of understanding of the consequences of violating the Laws and License terms. This Article XV
is intended to empower the Board to consider the circumstances of each case and provide a mechanism
by which Licensees can improve their compliance with the Laws in the future. 
B.  General Provisions
1.  No Illegality on Premises. No Licensee shall permit any illegality to occur on the
Licensed Premises, regardless of whether such illegality relates to the sale and service
of alcoholic beverages. The Manager of Record shall at all times maintain order and
decorum on the premises and in the immediately surrounding area of the premises and
Page 14 of 21 
Page 399
shall cooperate with City officials in ensuring safe and orderly facilities.

Police Department by the owner, Manager, Assistant Manager, or any employee of the
Licensee that becomes aware of an offense involving the Licensed Premises within
twenty-four hours of said violation unless the incident is serious enough to comprise
public safety and needs immediate attention at which time Framingham Police shall be
notified forthwith. Failure to report a violation involving the Licensed Premises
constitutes a violation of these Regulations and will subject the Licensee to appropriate
discipline in accordance with the procedure set forth herein.
3.  Penalties; Generally. Penalties for offenses shall be in line with the City’s general
goals of protecting public safety and the general welfare. Penalties will also be imposed
with the goal of preventing future offenses. A violation of these Regulations alone
(rather than state law or the Ordinances) may give rise to the issuance of penalties
pursuant to this Article to the extent permitted under law. The nature and severity of
the penalties imposed will be decided according to the nature of the offense and the
presence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances as further described herein. All
offenses by Licensees will result in the imposition of a penalty of some degree. This
will impress upon Licensees, managers, and servers their responsibility for ensuring
compliance with these Regulations, for prevention of offenses and for compliance with
the terms of licenses and the liquor laws of the Commonwealth.
a. Types/Categories of License Penalties. Penalties by the Board may consist of
any one or more of the following as appropriate: (a) Revocation of License; (b)
Suspension of License; (c) Modification of License; (d) Imposition of New
Conditions on the License; (e) Imposition of Monetary Fines; (f) Mandatory
Participation in Alcohol Abuse and Offense Prevention Programs; and/or (g)
any other reasonable penalty, in the Board’s reasonable discretion.
b. Penalty Guidelines. The penalty guidelines stated in these Regulations are
intended to provide indication of the range of penalties the Board will impose if
a hearing is held on any offense. The Board will refer to these guidelines by
deciding whether to approve a negotiated recommended resolution.
4. Police Department Recommendation; Negotiation Procedure; Record Keeping. The
Police Department is authorized to negotiate with any authorized representative of the
Licensee the terms upon which the Police Department will recommend to the Board that an
offense be resolved. 
a. Any such negotiated recommended resolution must be in writing, signed by the
Manager of Record or designated representative of the Licensee charged with
the offense and approved by the Police Chief. The recommendation must
include a statement detailing the facts determined in the Police Department
investigation. The recommended resolution is not binding upon the City unless
and until approved by the Board.
Page 15 of 21 
Page 400
b. If the Police Department and the Manager of Record and/or an authorized
representative of the Licensee cannot agree on a recommended resolution, the
Police Department will make any additional investigation it deems necessary
for a complete presentation of the facts and will file a written report with the
Board.
c. The Board may consider, but is not required to accept, a negotiated resolution
recommended by the Police Department. The Board is empowered to consider
alternative penalties consistent with this Article XV and the Laws.
d. The Police Department and the Board will maintain a public record of offenses
and their disposition that will be indexed according to the Licensee, Manager
or Assistant Manager, server and purchaser involved.
5. Notice to Licensee. Written notice shall be provided to a Licensee of an alleged
violation of the Laws. The notice provided to Licensee may contain the Police
Department's recommendation to the Board concerning the punishment for the alleged
violation. The notice will include the date of the event giving rise to the possible
disciplinary action, a description of the event, and a clear identification of the Laws that
are alleged to have been violated as a result of the event. Said notice will also provide
Licensee with the date upon which the Board will hold a hearing concerning the
Licensee's alleged violation. A notice containing the above-mentioned information shall
be sent to Licensee via certified mail return receipt requested no less than ten (10) days
prior to the date of the hearing before the Board. Licensees are entitled to retain counsel
to represent them at the hearing if they so desire.
6. Written Statement of Disciplinary Action. If the Board decides to take disciplinary
action against the Licensee for a violation of the Laws, the Board will provide the
Licensee with a statement of reasons why disciplinary action was taken against
Licensee. The above-mentioned statement of reasons will be included with the notice of
the Board’s disciplinary action.
C.  Determination of Penalties
Penalties will be determined according to the following procedure.
1.  The base level offense(s) will be determined from those offenses described in Article
XV, Section D.
2.  Adjustments according to the presence of factors that warrant an increase in the penalty
described in Article XV, Section E ("aggravating factors") or decrease described in
Article XV, Section F (“mitigating factors") will be considered.
3.  Adjustments according to the number of violations involved in the particular offense will
be considered.
4.  Adjustments according to the offender's acceptance of responsibility described in Article
Page 16 of 21 
Page 401
XV, Section F will be considered. 
5.  Increases according to the number and circumstances of prior violations and penalties
previously imposed upon the offender described in Article XV, Section G will be
considered. The Board is entitled to consider fines or suspensions issued by the
Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission in evaluating said prior violations and
penalties.
6.  Increases based on any previous written warnings given by the City to the Licensee will
be considered. Such increases will consider the date(s) of the written warning(s), the

Section H that is related to the base level violation will be considered.
