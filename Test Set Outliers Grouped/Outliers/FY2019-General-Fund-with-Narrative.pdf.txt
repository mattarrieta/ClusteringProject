Part time position to assist with payroll and serve as backup for Payroll Administrator and Payroll Coordinators when on vacations.
To meet a 1% reduction we would reduce this position from four days of five and a half hours to two days of six and a half hours a week. 
Since the part-time position is shared to assist with projects for both the School and Town Payroll and is the back-up for when the Payroll
Administrator is on vacation, it would be difficult to maintain the high level of service if this position was eliminated. In addition errors could be
made if the other employees are rushed or information may not be updated timely.

bills and over 1K in Personal Property per quarter. We also send out about 55K in Excise bills. This year we will be including the demand
notices for water, real estate and personal property, in past years we have done those in house and after an analysis I determined that it is not
cost effective to do these bills in house.

Tuition Reimbursement: Although I am not requesting additional funding for tuition reimbursement, I am concerned that this line item, 
although adjusted in FY 18, is not enough. We currently have 6 employees are pursuing degree programs and this only allows
reimbursement of 1 course per year. This is a big part of developing the workforce and succession planning. Tuition and fees have gone up, 
we have also agreed to pay more in collective bargaining, but we have not increased this line item for FY 2019. With tuition at FSU
increasing, another $3000 would help the employees in degree programs finish their degrees earlier and be prepared to step into more

Safety Training: The free training we have done has been well received by DPW and School Buildings and Grounds. We have accessed all
the free training we can find. We need to continue to create a culture of safety. We did receive a grant of just over $12,000 in FY 17 for
safety training in DPW and we will apply again for FY 19. If we do come under the OSHA mandate in FY 19 we will need some additional
money for trainers and training supplies. We need to focus more on workplace safety/violence prevention and would need an increase to
$2000 to get a program started.
HR-Benefits-Printing Services 435  -  -  2,500  2,225  (275) (11.00%)
Each year during open enrollment we print information for retired employees and teachers regarding health insurance benefits and any
changes. Printing includes enrollment forms, change booklets and rate sheets for retirees who are on active plans (non-medicare eligible) 
and medicare eligible retirees. We also print information for employee orientation including safety information.
HR-Benefits- (EAP) Program 11,638  10,500  10,513  10,500  10,500  -
The EAP assists with Employees in crisis as well as training programs and Health and Wellness. We continue to lag behind other
communities regarding our Health and Wellness programs. The town had more programing in the 1990’s and it appears to have been
eliminated in 2003. We should be doing a topic each month. We own many of our employees from the day they are hired, through the
employment cycle, into retirement. The healthier we can keep them now, the less they will cost us in the future. From the Rand study
“Considering the ratio of reductions in health care costs to program costs, including the fees of the program vendors and the cost of screening
employees for health risks, the overall ROI was $1.50—that is, a return of $1.50 for every dollar that the employer invested in the program. 
We will continue to look at ways to keep these programs going, especially lunch time yoga, one of our longest running wellness programs.

Benefits forms still require original forms. We are also required to mail notices for Medicare plans when the rates increase on the calendar
year as well as in the spring for the GIC open enrollment and rate changes. We also do mailings to retirees when they turn 65 and are
Medicare eligible. We must continue to anticipating changes in the Affordable Care Act and perhaps additional changes to the GIC Health
Insurance plans for FY 20. This will require educational information sessions for active employees and printing and mailings for retirees. We
need to maintain this account in order to get the information out to our retirees, including retired teachers.

we have accessed through our insurer, Travelers, has been well received by DPW and School Buildings and Grounds. We need to focus
more on workplace safety/violence prevention and would need an increase to $2000 to get a program started. If the OSHA mandate occurs in
FY 19, it will require funding. We will seek another grant for FY 2019 and will continue OSHA training for DPW and School Buildings and

Contractually obligated. Officers receive a weekly stipend if they are a "Specialist".  These are specified positions like 'Prints and Photos' and
Detective. The amount budgeted for FY19 was reduced from $84,000 to $66,500 because several officers are no longer eligible to receive the
annual specialist stipend of $3,500. There are 17 positions contractually determined as Specialist, occasionally there is overlap due to out-
going Specialist training in in-coming one.

There was a state program that incentivized education for police officers. It had been a percent of salary and funded by the government. 
Eventually that transitioned into being paid for by the City, as the program became unfunded. It is contractually determined. New officers still
receive an incentive, but it has gone to a flat amount rather than percentage of salary. As older patrol officers retire this number will become
lower as the flat amount is much smaller than the original percentage rates.

The Highway Division requires an overtime budget to address after hour emergencies such as storm related response for tree and flooding
issues, as well as safety related responses on roads and sidewalks, traffic & crowd control management, and high priority construction
activites that require extended operating hours. Road maintenance is the top priority for the Highway Division. Work hours will need to be
extended on a case by case basis during the upcoming construction season to allow the department to accomplish as many projects as
possible: road maintenance, sidewalks and curbing improvements, and drain structure repairs.
The budget has been increased to reflect the impact of new collective bargaining agreements with Locals 1116 & 1156 on this account. All

Street Sweeping is the most labor intensive program, second only to snow plowing operations, performed by the Highway Division. This
program utilizes all Division personnel within a compressed period of time in an effort to remove materials from the surface infrastructure to
preempt their introduction into the stormwater system. In order to accomplish this task within the briefest time period, the Department is
required to extend the work day and work weekends for a period up to sixty days. This period commences at the close of the winter season
and is intended to remove approximately 1,200 tons of sand and minimize its entry into the stormwater system. The timely execution of the
pavement markings maintenance function is completely dependent upon the completion of this street sweeping activity. This program is a
significant component of our compliance requirements of the federally mandated stormwater Best Maintenance Practices.
The budget has been increased to reflect the impact of the new collective bargaining agreement with Locals 1156 on this account.

Cemetery Contract = $21,560
The cemetery maintenance contract needs to go out to bid in FY19. Leone's Landscaping Company currently has the contract for $19,600. 
We are going to factor in a 10% increase in case the bid comes in higher in FY19. ($19,600 + $1,960 = $21,560)

historically interested people, students, and the general public. The old gravestones deteriorate and break via natural causes and vandalism. 
This line item is needed to repair these gravestones. This work is contracted with professional monument companies. Storms tend to loosen
the monument fittings of many grave sites pushing the gravestones further up and out. If they are not repaired they will topple over. We are
budgeting $1,000 for gravestone repairs in FY19.

Arbor Works Tree Company is our tree pruning vendor and they charge us $1,936 per day for tree pruning. We are budgeting for 4 days

05410311 51200 
Reducing the number participants in the Property Tax Program from 39 to 35 saves $2,900 ($725 x 4) without affecting services. However, 4
fewer seniors would receive the credit on their property tax bill for work performed for various town departments. In the past few years, we
have not been able to fill all 39 positions.
Salary & Wages - Partime 57,262  56,987  56,564  51,567  43,138  (8,429) (16.35%)
This line item is for two part-time salaried positions: A Bi-Lingual Social Services Outreach Worker who works 17 hours per week for 52
weeks and a Continuing Connections Coordinator who works 15 hours per week for 52 weeks. The FY19 salary request for these 2 part time
positions is considerably lower than last years adopted budget of $70,218 due to the Assistant Social Services Supervisor's position, that was
formerly budgeted in this part time salaries account last year, is now a full time position and is budgeted in the full time salaries line item. We
are using the Non - Bargaining M Salary Schedule effective 7/1/17 for this budget preparation. 
1% Budget Reduction: Reduce Continuing Connections Coordinator's Part Time Salary by $20,140
Reduce portion of Continuing Connections Coordinator’s wages paid by municipal funds and offset this amount by charging a fee for
participants to cover that expense of the program. Other towns charge a fee for respite programs with a similar population. Participants
struggle with financial and emotional strain of dealing with Alzheimer’s. The cost might affect some people’s ability to attend. Proceeds from
marathon donations to the Friends of Callahan, in the past few years, have covered non-staff expenses. The Friends of Callahan was not
chosen to be a marathon donations recipient in the 2018 random drawing of charities.

cancellations or changes to activities, increasing efficient use of staff. We also previously budgeted $936 in this account for the cost of copies

for a separate copier agreement. The toner costs will be covered by the Office Supplies account. The maintenance of the AED Machine and

We are reducing this line item by $350 because a decision was made to discontinue the practice of hanging banners for senior week events. 
The banners frequently become wrapped around themselves due to high winds. The banners only last 3-4 years before requiring repairs or

We plan to insert ads in the MWDN (Metrowest Daily News) about the center's programs and other advertising options. The Friends of
Callahan found this method did generate interest among people unfamiliar with the center. The local papers have been reducing the amount
of free space they allow to senior centers for information. Many seniors still prefer newspapers over the Internet for information. We think this
would generate more usage of the center's programs and services. This amount is available as a result of making reductions in other
categories of expenses.

Arena Laborer. We have since filled those two positions. We are using the latest W Seasonal Schedule effective 7/1/18 and T Salary
Schedules effective 7/1/17 for this budget preparation. There are no increases in hours, or weeks. Effective use of seasonal labor reduces
overall staffing expenses at the arena. The Arena Laborers positions are required to operate the ice resurfacing equipment, collect fees from

We have increased this account level service request by 3 percent each year in the last several years due to the increas in energy costs.  Description Actual Actual Actual Amended Recommended 2018 Amended to
Loring Arena currently has a new high efficiency boiler system for heating and cooling. This boiler replaced the original boiler to the arena that
was over 53 years old. While we anticipate having a significant cost savings with the new system, we will not know exactly what that savings is
until we have been fully operational in our completed new facility for at least one year.
Natural Gas  22,413  15,778  16,399  23,488  25,000  1,512
We are increasing Natural Gas by 3% from the FY18 Adopted Budget of $23,488 as per the CFO's Office. $23,488 plus 3% ($705) =
$24,193 . 
6.44%
1% Budget Reduction: Reduce Natural Gas by $2,925.
We increased this line item by 3% in our level service request as a recurring expense for Natural gas and the rising cost of energy itself. We
would not anticipate an increase in cost this year due to the installation of two new high efficiency boilers that replaced the original 50+ year
old boiler. However we will not know the full effect on actual cost savings until we are in full operation with our new and running facility for at
least one calendar year.

This account is for licensed repairmen, boiler, heating, dehumidifiers, plumbing, electrical, ammonia alarms, etc. We do much of our own
preventive maintenance and maintenance repairs. Certain things we hire out because they require licensed technicians or tradesmen such as
boiler repairs, electricians, plumbers, ammonia alarm service, etc. This account is also used for annual inspection of fire extinguishers as
well as $5,500 as a recurring expense for cleaning and maintenance of 6 infrared heating units. We annually alternate the cleaning of each
side (3 per side) , home vs. visitors. We would like to request a total of $26,580 for FY19. 
26.38%
8.14%
While the boiler was replaced with a brand new energy efficient system that will likely not need an intrusive amount of maintenence,we do still
anticipate requiring a budget in this line item similar to past years due to additional costs, such as the installation of an elevator which requires
annual maintenance and inspection. The first year of maintenance and inspections for the elevator is done by the installer at no change, after
the first year Loring Arena will be responsible for those fees. This year we will be adding a large number (15) of fire extinguishers that will need
to be place inside the new facility. Previously the front of the Arena only had 3. The extinguishers require annual inspection and service at an
additional cost.
This account is used for alignments, repairs, and inspections for a 2004 Ford Explorer. We are again requesting $1,000 for maintenance of
this vehicle.

Overtime is expended in the Park Maintenance Department to keep up with seasonal demands much the same way a landscaper will work
extensive hours to cover their spring and fall cleanup. The start of every athletic season requires us to get fields ready on time, extending the
work day and work week, as high schools and community organizations depend on our efforts. We Spent $145,436 in Overtime in FY17. We
are requesting a $10,000 increase for FY19 to maintain the same level of service.
1% Budget Reduction: Reduce Overtime by $10,000
This reduction in overtime, although not extensive, may lead to the Superintendent of Maintenance prioritizing projects/events that require
overtime, leading to a delay or elimination of certain activities such as the bonfire, movie night, metrofest, and egg hunt. Also, weekend
snowplowing at Cushing Memorial Park would be eliminated during the winter months

Sealcoating and Striping
Sealcoating (color coating) and crack filling of the tennis and basketball courts helps protect the surfaces and keeps them playable for our
residents over longer periods of time. We assess existing conditions at our facilities in the fall as we prepare our operating budgets for the
next fiscal year. Depending on existing conditions at our inventory of facilities in the spring of the budgeted fiscal year (16 months from now) 
we may be required to reallocate funding for repairs at alternate locations. Areas include 1 Arlington St. basketball court, 2 Mary Dennison
basketball courts, 4 Bowditch Tennis Courts, 4 Butterworth Tennis Courts, 1 Winch Basketball court, 6 Winch Tennis Courts, 1 Long's
Basketball Court, 1 Butterworth Basketball Court and 2 Bowditch Basketball Courts, and a host of half court basketball courts. This should be
part of an ongoing maintenance program with a few areas being done every year. Sealcoating lasts about 5 to 6 years depending on usage.

Maintaining the city's inventory of Park and School owned facilities requires ongoing maintenance and improvements. These improvements
are often undertaken utilizing a combination of contracted work coupled with in-house resources, equipment, and labor. We also leverage our
funds with community groups like Youth Lacrosse, Girls Softball, Rotary, etc. to accomplish improvements. The ability to maintain high quality
playing surfaces is most often dependent on availability of irrigation. Funding in this account is used to accomplish a wide range of
improvements including regrading substandard fields with suitable materials, installation of new irrigation systems, modifications to subsurface
systems and drainage systems, and general improvements to facility amenities as required. Costs can vary significantly depending on the
size of the fields or parks and the scope of work required. We have a written quote from Lawhorn Irrigation for $48,135 for installation of an
irrigation system at Anna Murphy Field. Half of the irrigation system will be installed in FY18 and half in FY19. We are requesting $24,068
(half of $48,135) for FY19. We would also like to budget $1,200 for our yearly Irrigation Monitoring Service with our vendor Baseline for our
Park owned fields.

In the maintenance division we need to repair power equipment, paint machines, pressure washer machines, chain saws, gang mowers, 
tractors, bobcats, seeder/slicers, scoreboards, parts cleaner service,etc. This account is very volatile & can easily be under budgeted with
some unexpected large bills that can occur with our heavy equipment or can easily be over budgeted if the numerous pieces of equipment we
own perform well in a given fiscal year. The Park Department Maintenance Mechanic along with the Superintendent of Park Maintenance &
Construction Supervisors determine when to send our departments heavy equipment to outside vendors for specialty repairs that we do not
perform. We spent over $12,000 in this account in FY15 due in large part to repair bills for our John Deere Tractor, Case Loader, Gang
Mowers and Bobcat. Our equipment performed well in FY16 and FY17 with only $2,083 and $415 spent on equipment repair in those

spring/struts replacements, transmission repairs, towing, radiator repairs, general engine repairs, etc. We also pay for vehicle inspections
(approximately $2,500 to $3,000) as well as at fault vehicle accident bills that fall below our deductible out of this account. We are again
requesting $22,000 again for FY19.

Throughout the year we are faced with situations that require hiring professional analysis and consultation services such as lighting
consultants, landscape architects, environmental engineers, structural engineers, soils analysis, etc. These services are critical to assessing
and addressing short-term infrastructure needs that impact our day-to-day operations, as well as securing engineering plans and estimates
associated with proper long-term capital planning. In addition, we apply for grants that require concept plans and engineering estimates in

we would like to budget $2.00 per gallon just in case the price increases. We are also going to budget for 13,000 gallons which falls in the

3.98%
o A Planning Board Administrator who is responsible for all permitting related to the Planning Board, office management, serves as a point of
contact for communication with land use applicants, plan review, and development thereof, as well as point of contact for public inquiry for the
Planning Board, Planning Board coordination, development of Zoning By-Laws/Ordinances, the Master Land Use Plan, Chapter 43D
expedited permitting functions, coordination with and for the municipality/State,/various other interconnected land use functions that impact

There is no proposed increase in funding for new personnel at this time, but rather a change in job description to the Communication Outreach
Coordinator position that would accommodate the creation of a new part time position for a recording secretary (outlined in below in Proposed
Salary & Wages Part Time) at weekly Planning Board evening meetings, which is desperately needed.

·  Professional & Technology – Consultants (01750021-53000): In 2014, the Planning Board and municipal staff undertook the process of
recodification of the Zoning By-Law, which will soon be Zoning Ordinances. The Recodification Team developed draft zoning based on best
practices, the needs of the Framingham community, and items identified in need of revision. Professional review by outside consultants is
essential to assist staff with the process of rewriting the Zoning By-Law/Ordinances in order to provide critical zoning relief that reflects current
best practices and indicated zoning policy. For example, the revisions to the Affordable Housing By-Law, were revised and rewritten as the
Inclusionary Housing By-Law by the Planning Board staff. Upon revisions made in house the proposal was then reviewed by professional
consultants who specialize in affordable housing policy and zoning amendments. This line item is specific to Zoning Ordinance review and
amendments. The Planning Board proposes that level funding of this line item remains from the FY18 budget and therefore, requests that
these funds remain available in FY19 (total of $5,000).

·  Professional & Technology – Engineering Services (01750021-53008): The Planning Board frequently requires professional review of its 
to
documents for final preparation to ensure that both legal compliance and site conditions are accurately determined. These funds are intended
to provide critical technical support where there is a void in staff capability, knowledge, or backup documentation required in order to meet
legal compliance that protects the municipality. The Planning Board proposes no change to this line item from the FY 18 budget and therefore, 
requests that level service funding remain available in FY19 (total of $2,000.00).
Printing Services  -  1,227  535  4,000  2,600  (1,400)
·  Printing Services (1750021-53050): The Planning Board is responsible for the Zoning By-Law/Ordinances, the Subdivision Rules and
Regulations, and the Master Land Use Plan. Every time an amendment is made to a land use document a new publication is required. Since
2014, the Planning Board has been recodifing the Zoning By-Law that has resulted in a request for additional funding in FY16 of $5,000.00 for
the purposes of printing the Zoning By-Laws and publications relative to Town meeting. 
(35.00%)
Since FY16, the Planning Board has printed numerous copies of the Zoning By-Law, Subdivision Rules and Regulations, and other
professional documents relative to zoning and land use with these funds. It is expected that with the change in government the number of
paper copies of printed material will be greatly reduced. Regardless, there still remains the need for more public outreach to disseminate
information to the public and interested stakeholders about zoning, permitting, and land use changes. The Planning Board proposes level
service funding remain to this line item from the FY18 budget. These funds are critical for the Planning Board to perform its legally required
functions. The Planning Board would request that these funds remain available in the FY19 budget ($4,000 printing budget).

Telephone (Office) (01750021-53401): The telephone is essential for the Planning Board Office for communication. With an increase in email
communication, the Planning Board proposes to decrease this line item by $25 from the FY18 budget for use on an alternative line item in the
operating budget. Therefore, the Planning Board requests that this funding remain as proposed in FY19 (total of $125).

·  Telephone – Cellular (01750021-53404): In FY18, the Planning Board purchased an IPad for the Associate Planner. The Associate
Planner spends approximately 50 percent of their time in the field reviewing construction projects. The Planning Board utilized ACCELA, a
web based permit tracking and reporting software, to increase efficiency, since it can be utilized in the field. Therefore, the Planning Board
provides a data package for the IPad that allows the Associate Planner to review site plans, provide mark-ups in the field, and provide a
review report of the site visit while in the field. Such data package is $19.99 per month. The remainder of these funds will be dedicated to a
Planning Board Office cellphone that allows staff in the field to utilize the office phone rather than personal cellphones for business related
calls when in the field. Since the Planning Board Office currently possesses both necessary devices (IPad and cell phone), the Planning
Board proposes to decrease this line by $800 from the FY18 budget, and thus transfer the funds to the Postage and Advertising line. 
Therefore, the Planning Board requests that these funds be available in FY19 for cellular communication (total of $1,000.00).

Postage  1,281  2,337  2,651  1,500  1,700  200
·  Postage (01750021-53430): Each year the number of projects reviewed by the Planning Board changes. Since 2014, the number of
projects reviewed by the Planning Board has increased above 20 consistently. For each project reviewed by the Planning Board, the Planning
Board Office is required to send written legal notices to all abutters within 300 feet of the project boundaries (500 feet for projects located on
scenic roadways), to the seven abutting municipalities, and parties of interest. The Planning Board provides notice of the legal ad and the
decision, which generates numerous legally required mailings for each project ($.34 per postcard sent). This line item also covers all
additional legally required mailings relative to zoning changes. 
13.33%
Historically, the Planning Board has had the experience of a shortage of funds for postage requirements. Therefore, the Planning Board
proposes to move $500 from a the line item of Cellular to this line item so to provide needed postage funds that will eliminate this continual
shortfall. This results in a $500 increase from the FY18 budget but no increase in the operating budget. Therefore, the Planning Board
requests that these funds be available in FY19 for postage (total of $2,000.00).
Communications - Advertising 887  1,579  1,575  1,500  1,800  300
·  Communications – Advertising (01750021-53440): The need for public outreach is both required by Massachusetts General Law (M.G.L.)
and essential for public involvement and knowledge. The Planning Board works diligently and is extremely mindful of its responsibility to
maintain compliance with M.G.L. With that being said, the Planning Board always works attentively to make its best effort to go above and
beyond to keep the public apprised of land use and zoning proposals and changes. 
20.00%
The Advertising line allows for the advertising of legal ads in the newspaper. The Planning Board must post legal notices as required for each
and every zoning or land use amendment made to the Zoning By-Law/Ordinances, the Subdivision Rules and Regulations, and the Master
Land Use Plan. Amendments to all of these documents is expected to continue and accelerate going forward with the change in municipal
government operations. The Planning Board proposes to increase this line by $300, by transferring funds from a line (Cellular) that no longer
needs additional funding. Therefore, the Planning Board requests that these funds be available in FY19 for advertising/communications (total
of $1,800).

·  Supplies – Office (01750021-54200): The Office Supplies line covers the Planning Board Office’s basic office supplies, which include
project binders, postcards for project mailers, pens, printer ink, etc. In 2014, the Planning Board changed its operations from hard paper copy
materials to electronic packets (each member of the Planning Board has a tablet) for their meetings, which decreased both printing and time
preparation of Planning Board packets (photocopying). However, with the increase in the number of Planning Board projects there is still a
need for folders, binders, postcards, etc. The Planning Board proposes no change to this line item from the FY18 budget and therefore, 
requests that these funding remain available in FY19 (total of $1,100).

·  Education, Training, Seminars (01750021-57120): The Planning Board requires a professional planning staff. Since it essential to retain
a current knowledge base in land use planning as well as current best practices. Educational training through programs, seminars, workshops
and related conferences is essential to employees and Planning Board members. The exchange of ideas and information amongst other land
use planners through educational seminars and related workshops and opportunities offered throughout Massachusetts and neighboring
states, which include Southern New England American Planners Association (SNEAPA) annual conference, Citizen Planners Training
Collaborative (CPTC), Baystate Roads, etc. provides essential training opportunities for career enrichment. Both Planning Board staff and
Board members take advantage of these educational opportunities on a regular basis since it is necessary in order to make informed
decisions regarding land use applications and zoning changes that effect the community as a whole. The Planning Board proposes no change
to this line item from the FY18 budget and therefore, requests that these funds remain available in FY19 (total of $2,500) for the purposes of
maintaining and expanding the Planning Board’s knowledge base.

·  Mileage Reimbursements (01750021-57130): Prior to FY18, the Associate Planner position was more office based. With the recent
increase in development projects, there was a need for this position to be in the field more than 50 percent of the time. The Associate Planner
conducts site visits to projects under review by the Planning Board and review of projects under construction that were permitted by the
Planning Board. The Associate Planner utilizes their own vehicle, but does put in for mileage reimbursement. This line also covers travel to
conferences and workshops by Planning Board staff and members of the Planning Board. There is a small increase of $15 to this line item for
the purposes of increased review of construction projects by the Associate Planner. This additional $15 comes from another line item, where
funds were not required. Therefore, the Planning requests that these funds remain available in FY19 for mileage reimbursement (total of
$1,485).

BARRACUDA MAIL ARCHIVER- OUR CURRENT MESSAGE ARCHIVER IS RUNNING AT 46% CAPACITY HAVING ARCHIVED 15,290,650
MESSAGES SINCE
SEPTEMBER 2009. DUE TO SIZE LIMITATION WE IMPOSE ON OUR MICROSOFT EXCHANGE MAILBOXES; OUR USERS END UP
ARCHIVING MESSAGES
FROM THEIR MAILBOXES TO LOCALLY STORED ARCHIVES CALLED PST FILES. WE AND MICROSOFT RECOMMEND THESE FILES
BE KEPT ON THE LOCAL
HARD DRIVE OF THE USER’S WORKSTATION. WE RECOMMEND USERS MANUALLY BACKUP THESE PST FILES TO USB THUMB
DRIVE ACCORDINGLY. THE
PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THESE PST FILES RUN THE RISK OF CORRUPTION RENDERING THEM USELESS. SINCE THEY ALSO
RESIDE ON THE LOCAL DRIVE
OF THE COMPUTER WHEN THERE ARE HARD DRIVES CRASHES OR WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE SOMETIMES THESE FILES ARE NOT
RECOVERED. THESE PST
FILES ARE ALSO UNREACHABLE FROM A USER IF THEY ALSO HAVE A LAPTOP AS THE FILES CAN’T BE SHARED. 
100.00%
BARRACUDA NETWORKS MAKES A PRODUCT “PST ENTERPRISE” THAT WILL CRAWL NETWORK DRIVES AND LOCAL STORAGE
ON PCS AND LAPTOPS TO
FIND THESE PST FILES AND IMPORT THEM INTO THEIR MESSAGE ARCHIVER SOLUTION, MAKING THEM SEARCHABLE BY THE
END USER FOR SATISFYING
PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST’S. THE COST WOULD BE $21,600/YEAR FOR 3 YEARS FOR A 5 YEAR SOLUTION.
