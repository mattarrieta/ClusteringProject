Health Information Exchange Patient Opt-Out Form
This form is to be used by patients who do not wish to participate
in the regional Health Information Exchange (HIE).
A Health Information Exchange, or HIE, is a way of sharing your health information among participating doctors’ offices, 
hospitals, care coordinators, labs, radiology centers, and other health care providers through secure, electronic means. The
purpose is so that each of your participating healthcare providers can have the benefit of the most recent information available
from your other participating providers when taking care of you. When you opt out of participation in the HIE, doctors and nurses
will not be able to search for your health information through the HIE to use while treating you. Your physician or other treating
providers will still be able to select the HIE as a way to receive your lab results, radiology reports, and other data sent directly to
them that they may have previously received by fax, mail, or other electronic communications. Additionally, in accordance with
the law, Public health reporting, such as the reporting of infectious diseases to public health officials, will still occur through
the HIE after you decide to opt out. Controlled Dangerous Substances (CDS) information, as part of the Maryland Prescription
Drug Monitoring Program, will continue to be available through the HIE to licensed providers.
This opt-out form only needs to be completed once to opt out of the HIE; it is not necessary to complete for each provider. 
If you do not live in the District of Columbia or Maryland, but still receive care in the region, you should complete this form
to opt out. If you wish to reverse your decision you may opt back in at any time by calling CRISP at 1.877.952.7477.
You have several options for opting out of the CRISP Health Information Exchange. Please select one below.
