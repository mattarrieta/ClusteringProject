FY21 Amended Budget Overview
When the initial submission of the FY21 budget was made the extent of the pandemic and the economic, social
and environmental impact were barely felt. The state and the economy was going to open up in less than a
week. Several federal aid packages had been passed but only the enhanced unemployment program had been
implemented. At the state level several laws had been changed to allow for increased financial flexibility. This
included the extension of certified free cash past the usual June 30th expiration date and the ability to apply for
deficit spending for unbudgeted pandemic expenditures. Federal and state disaster declarations had been
declared to allow for federal reimbursement of up to 75% of allowable pandemic expenditures. 
As this pandemic has unfolded over the last two and a half months, it has changed from a one year “trough” the
city needed to withstand to a two or perhaps three-year budget plan that needs to be carefully managed. We
have changed the budget for that longer term view. There are still unknowns regarding state aid, additional
federal aid specifically for education and the remaining distribution of municipal CARES Act funding by the
state. 
On Thursday, May 14th, the state issued the first of the federal CARES Act funds for cities and towns. 
Framingham’s allocation, based on a per capital distribution, is $6.447 million. The funds have restricted uses, 
primarily for pandemic expenses not covered by FEMA, for the 25% uncovered FEMA share and for expenses
and programs not covered by other federal and state aid funding sources. It cannot be used for revenue loss and
it cannot supplant regularly budget expenditures. It will provide financial resources, for pandemic expenditures
in FY21, which this amended budget recommendation does not. 
Changes in Revenue Assumptions
Local City Revenues – Reduced $2.8 million
•  Reduced local receipts by another $500,000 in room, meals and excise tax, user fees and Loring Arena
revenue. Total local receipts estimated at $24.7 million, a 6.5% total reduction from the original FY21
estimate and an 18% or $4.4 million from FY19 actuals. Excise, meals and room tax reduced 10% from
original FY21 revenue estimate and 25% from FY19 actuals. 
•  Reduced FY21 allocation/use of Free Cash by $2.3 million from $8.1 million in the original FY21
recommended budget to $5.8 million in the today’s amended FY21 recommended budget. 
External revenue resources
•  State Aid; no changes to assumptions made in the original budget submission – level funded
Unrestricted General Government Aid and $2.8 million increase in Chapter 70 aid which represents an
increase in enrollment only, Student Opportunity Act funds were already removed from the original
revenue assumption
•  FEMA federal reimbursement for pandemic expenditures – available for eligible expenditures made
through December 2020
•  CARES Act funding distributed via the state for pandemic expenditures, telecommuting expenditures, 
public health programs and residential aid programs and business aid programs (cannot supplant). Funds
were determined by a per capital formula – Framingham will receive $6.447 million to cover FY20 and
FY21 pandemic expenditures
•  CDBG/HUD funds for residential aid and small business aid programming - $319,000
•  ESSR federal funds direct to School Department - $1.8 million
•  The state is still holding onto 75% of the CARES act funding awaiting legislation at the federal level
that would allow funds to be used to replace lost revenue.

Budget Requests Recommend Recommend 
As part of original budget reductions
Division Head and Department Head
salaries were frozen at FY20 levels; 
operating expenses were lowered in
office supplies by 50% and decreased
most professional development by 50%.
The recommended budget for the School
Department assumed the elimination of
the Student Opportunity Act funding and
requirements. The original General
Fund budget recommendation filed on
April 30th increased $6.7 million or
2.3%.
In light of the changing fiscal
environment, the administration went back to review the budget and reduced the bottom line by $2.8 million,
primarily in salaries in municipal budgets which were cut by $1.2 million or 2.4% of personnel costs. The
General fund budget is increasing $3.84 million or 1.3%. The actions taken are not done lightly. The City has
built an excellent workforce that provides excellent service. Reduction at this level will not allow the same level
of service, but employees will strive to do the best they can with limited colleagues and limited resources. The
City must make it through this crisis with at least the core services intact: public safety departments must be
staffed to respond to emergency calls from residents and businesses; trash and recycle must be picked up and
removed to contracted landfills and recycle centers; and the public health must be maintained. In that light
budget cuts were made across almost all departments, except the Public Health Department, both in staffing and
operating costs. 
Additional budget reductions from the April 30th budget submission are listed below: 
•  Eliminate the $400,000 salary reserve – was built for FY21 collective bargaining negotiations
•  Further reduce $500,000 from School budget – we know now that summer school will be remote
learning which reduces costs for transportation and hiring many paraprofessionals to conduct summer
school in person; the new recommended budget for the School Department is $141,781,934 – an
increase of $3.3 million or 2.38% 
•  $45,000 from the Traffic Commission, reduced, but did not eliminate funding for traffic studies
•  $40,000 from the property/liability insurance self-insurance pool based on current year claims levels
•  $100,000 from health insurance based on reductions in force
•  $50,000 in Medicare tax due to reductions in force
•  Reduced General Fund Elections operating budget by $50,000; use $50,000 of state elections funding
reserved from prior years 
•  Cut $1.56 million from municipal department budgets. Combined, municipal budgets are $131,770
LESS than the budgeted amount for FY20
o Eliminated ten funded but currently vacant positions in Library, Park and Recreation, DPW
Highway and the Mayor’s Office. 
o Deferred hiring of two firefighter positions for four months
o Delayed hiring Assistant Fire Chief for two months
o Eliminated two part-time seasonal positions in DPW

o There are still three vacant, funded positions in the Library, two in Planning and Community
Development, two in the Public Health Department and three in the Fire Department and two in
the Police Department. Savings from delayed hiring and not funding vacancies is $699,000
o Deferred hiring two police officer positions for 11 months
o Lay off 13 employees across multiple departments saves $420,000 plus $79,000 in benefit costs. 
o Furlough an additional five employees for four months in FY2. 
o Further reduced operating expense budgets by $226,168 from the original recommended budget. 
•  Eliminated the deposit to the Stabilization Fund (Rainy Day Fund), leaving $305,000 in the balance of
free cash instead 
Existing City Resources Not Used in FY21-FY22 
Current Balance of Certified free cash: $15.7 million: use $5.8 million in this FY21 budget and $4 million to
offset revenue loss in the Utility Enterprise Fund which totals $9.8 million. That leaves a balance for Certified
Free Cash of $5.8 million. The State has changed the law regarding free cash so that is does not expire on June
30th; making it available for appropriation over the summer if circumstances change significantly. We expect to
turn back $2.5 million of municipal budgeted funds from FY20, assuming FEMA reimbursement. The School
Department will likely have a $3 million surplus at the end of FY20. FY20 revenues are tracking slightly less
than expected for some revenue types, but are favorable for our largest revenue sources. We are not seeing
major drop in FY20 revenue at this time except in water and sewer revenue as discussed on page four.

Framingham. Other Cities and
Towns, both members of the
Charges MWRA system and independent
systems with any kind of
commercial customer base are experiencing facing the same revenue losses. Unlike the General Fund, the City
has managed the Enterprise Fund more tightly, using modest year end balances to keep rate increases more
reasonable. There is no substantial free cash balance to help this revenue situation. It is safe to assume there
will be some type of financial relief at the state level. For FY20, the MWRA has already used the debt service
relief funds to reduce the final FY20 payment of the MWRA assessment – a $24,000 benefit to Framingham. In
FY2010, federal ARRA funds were used for principle debt forgiveness and Framingham received more than $12
million over the course of three years. 
Outlook for FY22 and FY23
The budget cuts made in this amended budget submission were made based on a two year view of the budget
period. That was one reason why layoffs were required versus furloughs of employees. A furlough is a short
term temporary fix. Most expect a furlough of a couple of weeks to a couple of months with an expectation of a
4

return to work. Looking forward to FY22 we could not make that assurance for employees; therefore the
decision to lay off employees was made. 
Forecasting from the lower revenue and expenditure levels proposed in this amended FY21 recommendation, 
allowing for modest growth in expenses (1.9% in municipal budgets and 3% in the School Department); the
FY22 budget would require a 1.6% base levy increase using $3.1 million in free cash. The Stabilization Funds
would stay intact.
