Human Growth and Development Opt-Out Request Form
The Human Growth and Development Curriculum has been in place for many years as an integral part of the
Health Education program. With input from students, parents, teachers, administrators, clergy, and health care
professionals, we have developed an excellent curriculum that allows your child to participate in
age-appropriate, scientifically based lessons.
The school district believes that the family plays a critical role in students’ growth and development education.
The school supports both parent/guardian and child in their effort to develop an understanding of human
sexuality.
Parents, who wish to exclude their son/daughter from portions of, or all of the human growth and development
unit, must place their request in writing. Please return this form to your child’s teacher prior to the start date
of the program designated by your child’s teacher. Students that are opted-out may be provided with an
alternative assignment on a health-related topic.
