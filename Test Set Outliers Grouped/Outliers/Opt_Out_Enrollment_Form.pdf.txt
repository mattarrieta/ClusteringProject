AUTHORIZATION - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY 
Authorization: I authorize CVT to remove me from any and all medical health benefit coverage offered to me through my employer. I have provided
CVT proof of other coverage as required to opt-out of CVT coverage. I acknowledge that by opting-out of CVT coverage, I will not receive medical
health benefits through CVT and may not be able to enroll for CVT coverage until an open enrollment date unless a qualifying event occurs. I also
acknowledge that by submitting a proof of other coverage I am agreeing that I am voluntarily choosing to enroll in the alternate coverage, which may
provide lessor benefits than those offered through CVT. I accept responsibility for any medical costs incurred that I may not have otherwise incurred
should I have decided not to opt-out of CVT coverage. I understand that by opting-out of CVT coverage I am no longer entitled to receive medical
health benefits through CVT. 
Email Address: The information you are asked to provide to CVT is used for technical and member administration only and is not shared with anyone
outside the confines of your health coverage. 
I acknowledge that legal action to resolve any benefit dispute will be through arbitration. 
I declare, under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California, that the foregoing is true and correct. 
CVT USE ONLY DATE COMPLETED
* Active employees opted out of CVT coverage are eligible for District-Paid Retiree and/or Self-Paid Retiree coverage if certain criteria are met. See CVT’s District-Paid Retiree
Guidelines and Self-Paid Retiree Guidelines for criteria requirements.
