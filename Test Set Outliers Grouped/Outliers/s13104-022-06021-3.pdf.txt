Abstract 
Objectives:  To assess potential non-target effects of genetically engineered/modified (GM) maize that produces
insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), numerous field experiments have been conducted worldwide. 
Field data are often variable and influenced by uncontrolled factors and meta-analyses can recognize general effects
with increased statistical power compared to individual studies. This database represents a comprehensive collection
of experimental field data on non-target invertebrates in Bt and non-Bt maize. It was created for a systematic review
with the question if growing Bt maize changes abundance or ecological function of non-target animals compared
to growing of non-GM maize. Systematic literature searches identified relevant data. Authors were contacted for
additional information or raw data if needed and a critical appraisal scheme was developed and applied to each data
record.
Data description:  The database contains 7279 records of non-target invertebrate abundance, activity density, or
predation or parasitism extracted from 120 articles. Records for individual species and life stages, but also aggregated
data are available. Each record represents a comparison of invertebrates in Bt and non-Bt maize and includes means, 
standard deviations and sample sizes. Additional variables characterize publication details, experimental setup, culti-
vars, Bt proteins, geographic location, field management, insecticide treatments, sampling details, and taxonomy.

animals compared to the growing of non-GM maize?”
[4, 5] The review was conducted within the EU project
GRACE (GMO Risk Assessment and Communication of
Evidence) [6]. It is limited to Bt maize because the most
non-target field data are available for this widely grown
crop. The systematic review followed the guidelines of the
Collaboration for Environmental Evidence [7]. Literature
published until August 2019 was searched systematically
in multiple bibliographic databases, websites, and refer-
ence sections of reviews with defined search terms to
identify relevant data. References were screened accord-
ing to a set of inclusion criteria. Authors were contacted
for additional information or raw data if the published
information was insufficient. A critical appraisal scheme
for non-target field data of GM crops was developed and
applied to each record in the database. The database has
been used as a basis for a range of meta-analyses, includ-
ing analyses on different non-target taxa and functional
groups, different types of Bt maize (Coleoptera-active, 
Lepidoptera-active, or stacks), and different insecticide
treatments (in particular pyrethroids) [5].
Data description
The database contains records of non-target inverte-
brates collected within Bt and non-Bt maize fields or
plots (Table 1, data file 1 [8]). Data were derived from
replicated field experiments. The measured outcome was
either abundance, activity density, or predation or para-
sitism rate. Each record represents a comparison between
Bt and non-Bt plots or fields and contains the seasonal
means of a particular taxon with a measure of variation
(SD) and sample size (N) for each type of maize. Com-
parisons involved Bt vs. non-Bt maize either untreated
or treated with the same insecticides, and untreated Bt
maize vs. insecticide-treated non-Bt maize.
In addition to the quantitative response data, a range
of descriptive variables characterize each record (Table 1, 
data file 2 [8]). Publication details include the source of
data, peer-review status, authors, affiliations and fund-
ing. Experiments (data from one location and one year) 
are described by the cultivar and Bt proteins, geographic
information, experimental design, field management, and
insecticide treatments. Details on the sampling method
and interval as well as on the recorded taxon, life stage, 
and functional group are provided. Further information
on data extraction, calculations, and the response vari-
able is given.
In many cases, multiple records are available that rep-
resent different taxonomic levels or different life stages
of a taxon. For example, records on species level as well
as aggregated records on family or order level have been
created. Means generally represent seasonal means of one
year and the SDs are based on the number of replicated
plots or fields. If data were not available in the desired
format, approximations were used whenever possible
(e.g., averaged means and SDs over individual sampling
dates to obtain a seasonal mean). In some experiments
multiple Bt maize lines were compared to the same non-
Bt control. In those cases, the database contains separate
records for each Bt line while the data for the non-Bt line
are used repeatedly.
Critical appraisal was applied to each record in the
database (Table 1, data file 3 [8]). The different appraisal
criteria include 16 questions to assess both internal valid-
ity (risk of bias) and external validity (the degree to which
the records are appropriate or applicable for answer-
ing the review question). Three answer categories were
defined: low, medium, and high validity. When informa-
tion was unavailable, the record was flagged “unreported”.
For each criterion, a decision was made if unreported
information should be treated as low, medium, or high
for the selection of records for meta-analyses, depend-
ing on the likelihood that the lack of information reduces
validity. For each question, clear cut off values were
defined to ensure transparency, consistency, and repro-
ducibility of the judgement.
The database contains 7279 records from 233 experi-
ments and 120 articles (Table 1, data file 1 [8]). The field
experiments were performed between 1994 and 2017. In
61% of the records in the database, invertebrates were
recorded in Bt and non-Bt maize without insecticide
treatment and in 8% of the records, Bt and non-Bt maize
received the same insecticide treatment. In 31% of the
records invertebrates in untreated Bt maize were com-
pared to those in insecticide-treated non-Bt maize.

Limitations
For some experiments that were identified in the sys-
tematic literature search, data suitable for inclusion into
the database could not be obtained, despite the effort of
contacting authors [5]. Data not fitting the requirements
of the database are summarized in [5]. Shortcomings of
the datasets that were entered in the database are princi-
pally addressed in the critical appraisal. Critical appraisal
questions and cut-off values were specifically designed
for this database, because there was no commonly agreed
critical appraisal scheme for arthropods collected in GM
crop field studies. The three most common issues identi-
fied in the critical appraisal were (1) lack of confirmation
of Bt protein expression in the plants (57% of records);
(2) seasonal mean was based on only three or fewer sam-
pling dates (30% of records); and (3) SD values of sea-
sonal means had to be estimated or recalculated, which
introduced uncertainty (18% of records). Furthermore, it
has to be noted that the records in the database do not
necessarily represent independent observations. Data
from control plots were used multiple times if different
Bt maize lines in one experiment had the same non-Bt
control. Records on different taxonomic levels (e.g., spe-
cies and family or order), on different life stages (e.g.,
larvae or adults and all stages combined), and on differ-
ent sampling methods that may have recorded the same
population of arthropods (e.g., visual observations and
sweep nets) were also included. If this database is used
for meta-analyses, it is thus warranted to select the most
appropriate records for the specific statistical model to
ensure independence of the analysed data. For the sys-
tematic review on non-target effects of Bt maize, such a
selection was done [5].
