How to Build Utility Rates
Rates are a function of costs and the
consumption of services
• Component 1: The budgeted cost to operate the water
and sewer system is set annually, recommended by the
Mayor and approved by the City Council.
– Increase in cost may raise rates
– Decrease in cost may reduce rates
• Component 2: the number of units of consumption
(usage) is projected based on analysis of actual billing
data. 
– Rising consumption can reduce rates
– Declining consumption can increase rates

• Usage is affected by domestic conservation measures
and weather. 
– FY20 usage generally follows FY19 usage

State Administrative Consent Order (ACO)
• Issued by DEP in 2007 required Framingham to
undertake major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects with the primary focus of addressing systemcapacity deficiencies and alleviating reoccurring
sanitary sewer overflows.
• The last specifically identified project from the ACO was
completed on schedule before the end of 2013. 
• While the City’s response addressed key deficiencies, 
more work remains. Improvements over the last 10
years have replaced/rehabilitated only 15.4% of the
system.
Page 11
Investment in the System & Impact on Rates
• FY06 through FY15 included heavy
investment in improvement projects
ordered by the state as part of the
Administrative consent order (ACO)
• The water and sewer systems are
highly regulated and require capital
maintenance, repair and
improvements to comply with state
regulations.
• We developed a financial plan that
details the level of investment that is
sustainable within a 2-3% annual
increase in rates.
