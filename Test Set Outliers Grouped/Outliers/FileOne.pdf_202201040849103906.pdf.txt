Dear Property Owner: 
The Board of Assessors is requesting INCOME AND EXPENSE information on COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL and
APARTMENT (residential) properties to help us determine equitable values for assessment purposes. This request is for income and
expense information relative to the operation of real estate and not the business use within the real estate. 
When determining income producing property values, the Board must weigh financial as well as physical attributes. By completing
and returning the enclosed form, you help ensure the development of a sound basis to estimate the income approach to value. Please
be aware that this information will be used only to determine `market' income and expense levels for commercial and industrial
properties and apartments. In accordance with State Law, all information listed on the forms is not available to the public for
inspection. [CH 59 S52B] 
While it is in the best interest of property owners to contribute to the establishment of fair assessments, Massachusetts Law also
requires such disclosure: Section 38D of Chapter 59
Written Return of Information to Determine Valuation of Real Property
A board of assessors may request the owner or lessee of any real property to make a written return under oath within sixty days
containing such information as may reasonably be required by it to determine the actual fair cash valuation of such property. 
Failure of an owner or lessee of real property to comply with such request within 60 days after it has been made by the board of
assessors shall be automatic grounds for dismissal of a filing at the appellate tax board. The appellate tax board and the county
commissioners shall not grant extensions for the purposes of extending the filing requirements unless the applicant was unable to
comply with such request for reasons beyond his control or unless he attempted to comply in good faith. If any owner or lessee of real
property in a return made under this section makes any statement which he knows to be false in a material particular, such false
statement shall bar him from any statutory appeal under this chapter. 
If an owner or lessee of Class one, residential (e.g. apartment) property fails to submit the information within the time and in the form prescribed, 
the owner may be assessed an additional penalty for the next ensuing tax year in the amount of $50 but only if the board of assessors informed the
owner or lessee that failure to submit such information would result in the penalty. 
If an owner or lessee of Class three, commercial or Class four, industrial property fails to submit the information within the time and in the form
prescribed, the owner or lessee may be assessed an additional penalty for the next ensuing tax year in the amount of $250 but only if the board of
assessors informed the owner or lessee that failure to so submit such information would result in the penalty. 
Please note: Massachusetts General Law provides that failure to respond timely and accurately to this information request within sixty
(60) days of the postmarked date shall cause you to lose your right to appeal your assessment. 
All information provided is confidential and protected from public disclosure
The Board of Assessors thanks you for cooperation.
