Tow Company Satisfaction Survey
Whenever a motor vehicle is ordered towed by the Framingham Police Department, anyone of
several local tow companies can be called upon to remove the vehicle. These companies have
contracted with the police department to provide their tow services. 
In an effort to properly manage these contracts, as well as maintain this department's focus on
customer service, you are asked to complete the following survey. 
Issues or concerns you may have with the police ordering your vehicle towed should be directed to
the department and should not influence your responses to this survey. Again, the purpose of this
survey is to assess the level of service provided by the tow company. 
•  This survey is completely voluntary. 
•  Your answers will be kept in strict confidence and your identity will not be revealed to the tow
company. 
•  If you have a specific complaint that you wish to have investigated, feel free to include it with
the survey.

A note on privacy 
The record kept of your survey responses does not contain any identifying information about you
unless a specific question in the survey has asked for this. If you have responded to a survey that
used an identifying token to allow you to access the survey, you can rest assured that the
identifying token is not kept with your responses. It is managed in a seperate database, and will
only be updated to indicate that you have (or haven't) completed this survey. There is no way of
matching identification tokens with survey responses in this survey.
