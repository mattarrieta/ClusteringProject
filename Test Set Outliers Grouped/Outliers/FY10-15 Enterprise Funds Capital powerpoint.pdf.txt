Estimated Rate Changes
 Debt service increases by 13.7% in Water and 20% in
Sewer.
 However, when combined with the rest of the water
and sewer budget components (pending TM vote),
the total increase in the Water budget is .8% and
Sewer budget is 7%.
 Estimated rate changes assume same consumption
as FY09, no use of retained earnings for mitigating
rates.
