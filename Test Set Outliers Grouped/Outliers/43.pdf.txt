35th ANNUAL
TEXAS LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE
May 11, 2001
To:  Texas Legislative Conference Committees
From: Michael Meek, Program Director
Subject: 2002 Texan of the Year Recommendation
The Conference Arrangements Committee met to critique the 2001 conference this morning and begin planning
for the 2002 event. As you may recall, George W. Bush was the joint committee’s first choice as Texan of the Year for
2001. However, with the ballot-counting delays, we were not able to inform him until late December and by then he
was unable to commit to our March event. President Bush did state that he was honored to have been selected and
would like to be considered again and suggested we give his schedulers up to nine months notice.
Well, we’re ten months away from the 2002 event! Thus, the Arrangements Committee is recommending we
reaffirm George W. Bush as our selectee – this time for the 2002 event – and make the offer as soon as possible. This
way, we would know by our November 2001 joint meeting whether or not he can come as well as when. Plans could
then progress on the program., etc. . . .
Please indicate your vote below and return to us by Friday, May 18. Thank you.
