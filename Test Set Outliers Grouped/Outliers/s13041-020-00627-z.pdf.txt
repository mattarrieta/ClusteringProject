Abstract
Accumulating evidence implicates dysregulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the pathophysiology of
depression. However, the effects of ketamine on synaptic plasticity and their contribution to its mechanism of
action as an antidepressant, are still unclear. We investigated ketamine’s effects on in vivo dorsal hippocampal
(dHPC) synaptic plasticity and their role in mediating aspects of antidepressant activity in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)
model of depression. dHPC long-term potentiation (LTP) was significantly impaired in WKY rats compared to Wistar
controls. Importantly, a single low dose (5 mg/kg, ip) of ketamine or its metabolite, (2R,6R)-HNK, rescued the LTP
deficit in WKY rats at 3.5 h but not 30 min following injection, with residual effects at 24 h, indicating a delayed,
sustained facilitatory effect on dHPC synaptic plasticity. Consistent with the observed dHPC LTP deficit, WKY rats
exhibited impaired hippocampal-dependent long-term spatial memory as measured by the novel object location
recognition test (NOLRT), which was effectively restored by pre-treatment with both ketamine or (2R,6R)-HNK. In
contrast, in WKYs, which display abnormal stress coping, ketamine, but not (2R,6R)-HNK, had rapid and sustained
effects in the forced swim test (FST), a commonly used preclinical screen for antidepressant-like activity. The
differential effects of (2R,6R)-HNK observed here reveal a dissociation between drug effects on FST immobility and
dHPC synaptic plasticity. Therefore, in the WKY rat model, restoring dHPC LTP was not correlated with ketamine’s
effects in FST, but importantly, may have contributed to the reversal of hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits,
which are critical features of clinical depression. Our findings support the theory that ketamine may reverse the
stress-induced loss of connectivity in key neural circuits by engaging synaptic plasticity processes to “reset the
system”.

Introduction
Accumulating evidence implicates dysfunction within
glutamatergic systems and dysregulation of synaptic
plasticity in the pathophysiology of depression [1–7].
Preclinical studies have established that chronic stress is
associated with pathological glutamate excitotoxicity and
synaptic dysfunction, leading to reductions in dendritic
branching and spine density, and eventually neuronal at-
rophy of pyramidal neurons in areas implicated in major
depressive disorder (MDD),  particularly the hippocam-
pus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) [1, 3, 5, 8–10].
Importantly, electrophysiological studies indicate that
stress can perturb the normal balance in synaptic plasti-
city, by inhibiting long-term potentiation (LTP) and/or
facilitating long-term depression (LTD),  mainly in the
rodent HPC (for review, [7]).  When prolonged (e.g.
under chronic stress), such an imbalance may predispose
toward synaptic destabilization and neuronal atrophy,
possibly mediating the structural and functional findings
in MDD [3, 7, 11–14].  Importantly, depressed patients
show significant grey matter volume reductions, particu-
larly in the HPC and PFC, as well as various cognitive
deficits (e.g. in attention, episodic memory and executive
function) [3, 7, 11–14].  These effects, along with the
core symptoms of emotional dysregulation and anhedo-
nia [15–17], could all be mediated by impaired synaptic
plasticity and loss of connectivity between key brain re-
gions highly vulnerable to stress (for review, [7]). Despite
recent progress, further research is clearly needed to
clarify the role of synaptic plasticity in the pathophysi-
ology of depression and in mediating antidepressant
response.
Ketamine’s efficacy in treatment-resistant depression
(TRD, i.e. in patients who have previously failed to re-
spond to two or more classical antidepressants),  holds
promise for a new generation of much needed, superior
antidepressant agents. Given its short plasma half-life (~
1–3 h),  ketamine’s  sustained antidepressant actions
(~days-weeks) appear to be due to activation of crucial
downstream signaling cascades as a secondary conse-
quence of inhibiting the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspar-
tate receptor (NMDAR),  resulting in long-lasting
adaptations in key neural circuits [3, 18–20]. Ketamine
recruits intracellular signaling cascades, particularly
those involving the brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) and the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), and is thought to initiate an LTP-like process
involving acute activation of the glutamate α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor
(AMPAR) and sustained enhancement of AMPAR-
mediated transmission [18].  Ultimately, ketamine in-
creases the ratio of AMPAR to NMDAR throughput via
directly blocking NMDARs and indirectly enhancing
AMPAR function, leading to synaptic protein synthesis, 
synaptogenesis and reversal of stress-induced synaptic
dysfunction and neuronal atrophy in brain areas impli-
cated in MDD (HPC, PFC) (for review, [7]).  Although
these key molecular and structural effects are now well
established, mechanisms underlying the drug’s anti-
depressant effects on a “systems level” remain unclear.
One theory is that ketamine may reverse the loss of nor-
mal connectivity between the HPC, PFC and associated
regions by engaging synaptic plasticity and synaptogene-
sis to “reset the system” [7].  However, the number of
systematic studies of ketamine’s effects on regional syn-
aptic plasticity, especially in vivo and in the context of
depression, remain limited.
In 2016, an active ketamine metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydro-
xynorketamine (HNK),  was reported to exhibit anti-
depressant efficacy in rodents without NMDAR binding
properties or key side effects of its parent compound
[21]. These intriguing findings prompted a re-evaluation
of the NMDAR hypothesis of ketamine; however, several
groups subsequently failed to demonstrate any anti-
depressant activity of (2R,6R)-HNK in various rodent
models, giving rise to controversy [22–25]. Overall, this
metabolite may recapitulate some aspects of ketamine
action by indirectly facilitating AMPAR-mediated trans-
mission [19, 21, 26]; however, its exact mechanism of ac-
tion and contribution to ketamine’s therapeutic effects
remain unknown and warrant further investigation.
It is becoming increasingly clear that purely stress-
based animal models of depression largely ignore im-
portant clinical factors, such as depression vulnerabil-
ity and antidepressant resistance [27–30].  Thus,
drugs that simply reverse the neurotoxic effects of
stress in the otherwise normal brain may have lim-
ited efficacy and scope of antidepressant action [28,
29]. As we seek to ensure that the next generation of
antidepressants will be effective for vulnerable and
treatment-resistant populations, animal models
should encompass not only stress-induced phenotypic
parallels to clinical depression, but also aspects of
heightened stress susceptibility and resistance to con-
ventional antidepressant drugs [27, 29, 30].  Accumu-
lating research supports the use of the Wistar-Kyoto
(WKY) rat as a valid model of endogenous stress
susceptibility and depression that exhibits various
depressive-like phenotypes (e.g. behavioural inhib-
ition, psychomotor slowing, anhedonia, social with-
drawal, anxiety, cognitive deficits),  as well as key
neurochemical and endocrine parallels to MDD (e.g.
deficient monoamine and neurotrophin signaling,
aberrant glutamatergic function, hippocampal and
cortical volume loss, and hyperactive hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis) (for review, [7]).  Im-
portantly, this strain is a  model of treatment
resistance to classical antidepressants (e.g. selective
Page 3

serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs),  and responds
well to novel rapid-acting antidepressant therapies
proven effective in TRD, particularly ketamine [7,
29].
To evaluate the role of dorsal hippocampal (dHPC)
synaptic plasticity in depression and ketamine’s anti-
depressant response, we used the WKY model to investi-
gate the effects of ketamine on Schaffer collateral (SC) -
CA1 LTP and their contribution to its antidepressant ac-
tivity, particularly as it relates to an aspect of spatial
memory function known to be mediated by this region
of the hippocampus.
Methods and materials
Subjects
Stress-susceptible Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and control
Wistar (WIS) rats (male, age 10–12 weeks at arrival;
Charles River, USA) were pair-housed under a reverse
light/dark cycle, with food and water available ad libi-
tum. Animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the Canadian Council of Animal Care and with the
approval of the Animal Care Committee at the Univer-
sity of British Columbia.
Drugs
Ketamine and its metabolite (2R,6R)-HNK (5 mg/kg)
were dissolved in saline and administered intraperitone-
ally (ip) at a final volume of 1 ml/kg. Ketamine HCl was
purchased from Medisca Pharmaceuticals Inc. (St-Laur-
ent, Quebec). (2R,6R)-HNK was synthesized and verified
in our lab, according to a published protocol [21]
(Supplementary Methods and Fig. S1).
Behavioural assays
After a week of acclimatization, naïve or drug-treated
(WKY or WIS) rats underwent behavioural testing on
three different preclinical tests (one per cohort):  the
open field test (OFT, 10 min session), the forced swim
test (FST, 2-day procedure) or the novel object loca-
tion recognition task (NOLRT, at 1 h or 24 h delay
for short- and long-term memory), with drugs admin-
istered at different time points before testing. For
detailed descriptions of behavioural protocols, see
Supplementary Methods.
In vivo electrophysiology
Dorsal hippocampal synaptic plasticity was evaluated
using single unit field electrophysiological recordings in
anesthetized rats (urethane, 1.5 g/kg, ip), according to a
previously published protocol [9] (Supplementary
Methods). Briefly, a stimulating and recording electrode
were lowered into the SC and CA1 stratum radiatum,
respectively. Evoked field excitatory post-synaptic poten-
tials (fEPSPs) were recorded in naïve and drug-treated 
rats. Three stimulation protocols were applied (one per
cohort) to induce weak LTP (wLTP 1x100Hz, 1 s),
strong LTP (sLTP 4x100Hz, 5 min apart), or LTD (3 Hz,
900 pulses, 5 min), with drugs given at 30 min, 3.5 h or
24 h before LTP/LTD induction. Normalized fEPSP
slope was analyzed and compared between experimental
groups at different time points of the recording (in 5
min time bins).  For detailed descriptions of electro-
physiological protocols and analyses, see Supplementary
Methods.
Data analysis
Data are presented throughout as mean ± SEM, where
n is the number of rats. Throughout the study, most
comparisons were conducted by 1- or 2- way analysis
of variance testing (ANOVA, independent groups or
repeated measures, as specified in Supplementary Re-
sults) with appropriate post-hoc tests (Tukey’s  or
Sidak’s, as detailed in the text), or on a few occasions
by a two-tailed t  test. Results were analyzed and
graphed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, Cali-
fornia, USA).  Significance in all analyses was set at
α = 0.05, with multiplicity adjusted p values for each
comparison reported throughout. For key raw data
and detailed descriptions of statistical analyses, see
Supplementary Results.
Results
Ketamine decreases FST immobility in WKY and WIS rats
Consistent with the literature, stress-susceptible WKY
rats were characterized by dramatic day2 FST immobil-
ity compared to normal WIS controls (30 min SAL
WKY vs. WIS, two-tailed t test, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1a, b),
indicative of abnormal stress coping. Consistent with
their behavioural inhibition phenotype, WKYs also ex-
hibited less general locomotor activity compared to WIS
rats (30 min SAL WKY vs. WIS, two-tailed t test, p <
0.0001) (Fig. 1c, d). Ketamine (5 mg/kg, ip) significantly
decreased day2 FST immobility in both strains compared
to their corresponding saline-treated controls at 30 min
and 24 h after injection (significant ANOVA main effect
of drug treatment, p < 0.0001; KET vs. SAL at 30 min/24
h, WKY: Sidak’s p < 0.0001 and WIS: p < 0.0073),  with
drug effects being comparable at 30 min and 24 h (no
significant ANOVA time main effect or interaction, p >
0.05, n.s.) (Fig. 1a, b). On the other hand, ketamine had
no significant effect on general locomotor activity in the
OFT at these time points in either strain (no significant
ANOVA drug treatment main effect or interaction,
p > 0.05, n.s.) (Fig. 1c, d). Therefore, ketamine was found
to have significant rapid (30 min) and sustained (24 h)
antidepressant-like effects as indicated by the FST, in both
WKY and WIS rats.

Stress-prone WKY rats have a significant SC-CA1 LTP
deficit
We performed in vivo extracellular recordings in anes-
thetized rats and found that basal SC-CA1 synaptic
transmission was comparable between stress-prone
WKY and control WIS rats, as indicated by similar
fEPSP slope input-output curves (significant ANOVA
stimulation current main effect and stimulation current
x strain interaction, p < 0.0001, but no strain main effect;
WKY vs. WIS at any current intensity, Sidak’s p > 0.66)
(Fig. 2a). Following a low-frequency stimulation protocol
(3 Hz, 900 pulses, 5 min), average fEPSP slope was tran-
siently reduced in all rats (significant ANOVA main
effect of time only, p = 0.0076; 5 min pre- vs. 5 min post-
LFS, WKY: Tukey’s p = 0.14, n.s. and WIS: p = 0.04);
however, we failed to detect any robust or long-lasting
LTD in either strain (5 min pre- vs. 30 min post- LFS,
Tukey’s p > 0.83, n.s.;  30 min post-LFS WKY vs. WIS,
Sidak’s p = 0.77, n.s.) (Fig. 2b), indicating no significant
facilitation of LTD in stress-prone WKY rats.
On the other hand, we found that SC-CA1 LTP was sig-
nificantly impaired in WKYs compared to WIS controls 
(Fig. 2c-f). Both the induction and maintenance phases of
weak LTP (wLTP) following a single train of high-
frequency stimulation (HFS: 100 Hz, 1 s) were significantly
less pronounced in WKY compared to WIS rats (signifi-
cant time x strain ANOVA, p < 0.0022, 5 min post-HFS
WKY vs. WIS, Sidak’s p = 0.0007; 30 min post-HFS WKY
vs. WIS, Sidak’s p = 0.0005). Despite some decay in both
strains (5 min post- vs. 30 min post- HFS, WKY: Tukey’s

served 30 min later in control WIS rats only (5 min pre-
vs. 30 min post- HFS, WKY: Tukey’s p = 0.41, n.s. and
WIS: p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2c, d). At the end of the recording,
13/26 (50%) of WIS and 2/21 (9.5%) of WKY rats still
expressed robust (20% or more) wLTP.
Following a stronger HFS protocol (4 trains of 100 Hz, 5
min apart), the induction phase of strong LTP (sLTP) was
no longer significantly different between the two strains
(significant time x strain ANOVA, p < 0.025; 5 min pre- vs.
5 min post- HFS, Tukey’s p < 0.0001 for WIS and WKY
rats; 5 min post-HFS WKY vs. WIS, Sidak’s p = 0.30, n.s.)
(Fig. 2e, f). Importantly, however, in control WIS rats, there
was no significant decay in potentiation (90 min post- vs. 5

induction was significantly compromised in WKY compared to WIS rats (# # #p = 0.0007), and despite some decay in both strains (‡p = 0.03 and
‡p = 0.02), significant wLTP was still observed 30 min later in control WIS (***p < 0.0001) but not WKY rats (p = 0.41, n.s.; vs. WIS # # #p = 0.0005).

was still observed 90 min after induction (90 min post- vs.
5 min pre- HFS Tukey’s p < 0.0001), whereas synaptic po-
tentiation in the WKY strain was completely lost within 60- 
90 min (90 min post- vs. 5 min pre-HFS Tukey’s p = 0.76,
n.s.; vs. 5 min post- HFS Tukey’s p = 0.0006; 90 min post-
HFS WKY vs. WIS, Sidak’s p = 0.001) (Fig. 2e, f). At the
end of the recording, 10/14 (71%) of WIS and 2/12 (17%)

of WKY rats still expressed robust sLTP. Therefore, while
the magnitude and duration of LTP were enhanced in both
strains by using a stronger induction protocol to convert
weak to strong LTP, we found strong evidence of a signifi-
cant deficit in SC-CA1 sLTP maintenance in stress-prone
WKY rats.
Ketamine acutely restores normal SC-CA1 sLTP in WKY
rats
Next, we tested the effects of ketamine (5 mg/kg, ip) on
the impaired WKY sLTP at three different time points 
(30 min, 3.5 h and 24 h) after injection. First, ketamine
did not have any significant acute effect on SC-CA1
basal synaptic transmission in WKYs (significant
ANOVA main effect of time only, p = 0.0002; 5 min pre-
drug vs 5 min pre-HFS, Tukey’s p = 0.98, n.s.) (Fig. 3a).
When the HFS protocol was given 30 min post-injection
(Fig. 3a, b),  sLTP induction and decay was more pro-
nounced in saline (5 min pre- vs. 5 min post-HFS,
Tukey’s p < 0.0001) than in ketamine (p = 0.14, n.s.)
treated rats; however, differences in potentiation be-
tween saline and ketamine groups were not significant at
Fig. 3 (See legend on next page.)

Fig. 3 Ketamine restores SC-CA1 sLTP in WKY rats at 3.5 h but not 30 min after injection, with residual effects at 24 h. a, b WKY saturated LTP at
30 min post-injection by (a) drug treatment and (b) time bin (SAL: n = 12, KET: n = 5). Ketamine administration had no significant acute effects on
WKY basal synaptic transmission. Although sLTP induction only reached significance in saline (***p < 0.0001) but not ketamine (p = 0.14, n.s.)
treated rats, there were no significant differences between the two groups at any time point, and no significant sLTP was observed at 90 min as
before, regardless of the treatment group (statistically significant decay in SAL rats only, ‡ ‡ ‡p = 0.0008). c, d WKY sLTP at 3.5 h post-injection by
(c) drug treatment and (d) time bin (SAL: n = 19, KET: n = 18). Initially, significant sLTP was observed in both groups (***p < 0.0001); however,
while potentiation again completely decayed in saline-treated WKYs (‡ ‡ ‡p < 0.0001), robust sLTP was still present at 90 min post-HFS in the
ketamine group following only partial decay (***p < 0.0001; ‡ ‡p = 0.003; vs. SAL # # #p = 0.0003). e, f WKY sLTP at 24 h post-injection by (e) drug
treatment and (f) time bin (SAL: n = 12, KET: n = 10). Significant sLTP was induced in both saline (***p = 0.0004) and ketamine (***p = 0.0009)
treated WKYs; however, while the potentiation again completely decayed over the 90 min in the saline group (‡ ‡p = 0.0024), only partial decay
was observed following ketamine (p = 0.17, n.s.), so that some sLTP was still present 90 min post-HFS (p = 0.097, n.s.). (G) WKY I/O curves at 24 h
(SAL: n = 12, KET: n = 10, same rats as in (e, f)). fEPSP slope across all current intensities was consistently higher 24 h following ketamine compared
to saline treatment, with the stimulation magnitude evoking ~ 50% of the maximal response effectively shifted leftward (from 100 μA to 60 μA) in
ketamine-treated rats. h WIS sLTP at 3.5 h post-injection by drug treatment (SAL: n = 6, KET: n = 3). Ketamine had no significant acute effects on
WIS basal synaptic transmission. Significant sLTP was observed in both saline p = 0.0003) and ketamine p < 0.0001) treated WIS rats, and
independent of the treatment group, robust sLTP was still present 90 min later (SAL: p = 0.028 and KET p = 0.013). Single big arrow = drug injection,
4 small arrows = strong HSF protocol; * vs. [1] = potentiation effect, ‡ vs. [2] = decay effect, # vs. SAL = treatment effect; *p ≤ 0.05,

any time point (Sidak’s p > 0.51, n.s.). In addition, no sig-
nificant WKY sLTP was observed at 90 min as before,
regardless of the treatment group (5 min pre- vs. 90 min
post-HFS, Tukey’s p > 0.76, n.s.; with statistically signifi-
cant decay in SAL rats only, 5 min post- vs. 90 min post-
HFS, Tukey’s p = 0.0008).
When the HFS protocol was given 3.5 h post-injection
(significant time x drug treatment ANOVA, p < 0.0088)
(Fig. 3c, d),  sLTP induction itself was not significantly
affected by ketamine (5 min pre- vs. 5 min post-HFS,
Tukey’s p < 0.0001 for SAL and KET; 5 min post-HFS
SAL vs. KET, Sidak’s p = 0.99, n.s.). Interestingly, regard-
less of the treatment group, the sLTP induced in WKY
rats was more robust when the HFS protocol was given
3.5 h compared to 30 min after injection (Figs. 3c, d and
2e, f), indicating that simply allowing the synapses to re-
cover over a few hours after electrode placement and/or
anesthetic administration may facilitate the induction of
LTP in this strain. Importantly, however, while sLTP in
saline-treated WKY rats again completely decayed (90
min post- vs. 5 min pre- HFS, Tukey’s p = 0.75, n.s.; vs.
5 min post- HFS, Tukey’s p < 0.0001),  significant sLTP
was still present in the ketamine treated group at 90 min
post-HFS following only partial decay (90 min post- vs.
5 min pre- HFS, Tukey’s p < 0.0001; vs. 5 min post-HFS,
Tukey’s p = 0.003; 90 min post-HFS SAL vs. KET, Sidak’s
p = 0.0003).  Thus, ketamine effectively restored normal
SC-CA1 sLTP in WKY rats (Fig. 3c, d), with the magni-
tude of synaptic potentiation comparable to that ob-
served in normal WIS rats (~ 140% at 90 min; Fig. 2e, f).
Consistent with this, at the end of the recording, 13/18
(72%) of ketamine-treated WKY rats (vs. 71% of control
WIS rats) and 4/19 (21%) of saline treated WKY rats still
expressed robust sLTP at 90 min post-HFS. Therefore,
ketamine completely eliminated the SC-CA1 sLTP def-
icit in WKY rats at 3.5 h after injection, reflecting a 
robust facilitatory effect on the maintenance of LTP in
this model.
When the HFS protocol was given 24 h post-
injection (significant ANOVA main effect of time
only, p < 0.0001),  significant sLTP was induced in
both saline (5 min pre- vs. 5 min post-HFS, Tukey’s
p = 0.0004) and ketamine (p = 0.0009) treated WKYs,
and differences in potentiation between the two treat-
ments did not reach statistical significance at any
time point (Sidak’s p > 0.22, n.s.) (Fig. 3e, f). However,
interestingly, while complete sLTP decay was again
observed within 90 min following saline (5 min pre-
vs. 90 min post-HFS, Tukey’s  p = 0.80, n.s.,  5 min
post- vs. 90 min post-HFS, p = 0.0024),  only partial
decay was observed in the ketamine group (5 min
post- vs. 90 min post-HFS, Tukey’s p = 0.17, n.s.),  so
that some sLTP was still present 90 min post-HFS (5
min pre- vs. 90 min post-HFS, Tukey’s p = 0.097,
n.s.),  suggesting some residual drug effect on SC-CA1
sLTP at 24 h after administration. Consistent with
this, at 90 min post-HFS, 5/10 (50%)  ketamine and
only 2/12 (17%) corresponding saline-treated rats still
expressed robust sLTP. Although ketamine’s facilita-
tory effect on sLTP maintenance at 24 h was not as
pronounced as at 3.5 h, this treatment did cause a
dramatic leftward shift of the WKY SC-CA1 fEPSP
slope input-output curve at 24 h (significant ANOVA
current intensity main effect and current intensity x
drug treatment interaction, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.004;
drug treatment main effect, p = 0.14, n.s.) (Fig. 3g).
fEPSP slope was consistently higher in the ketamine
group at any current intensity, where the stimulation
magnitude evoking ~ 50% of the maximal response
was effectively shifted leftward (from 100 μA to
60 μA) in rats pre-treated with ketamine compared to
saline. The latter effect is consistent with a prolonged

enhancement of basal synaptic transmission as a re-
sult of sustained ketamine-induced potentiation at this
synapse.
Interestingly, under our experimental design, keta-
mine’s robust synaptic effect was restricted to the WKY
SC-CA1 sLTP deficit, as ketamine had no significant ef-
fects on sLTP at 3.5 h post-injection in control WIS rats
(significant ANOVA main effect of time only, p <
0.0001).  As in WKYs, ketamine administration had no
significant acute effect on WIS basal synaptic transmis-
sion (5 min pre-drug vs. 5 min pre-HFS, Tukey’s p =
0.96, n.s.); however, there were no significant differences
in sLTP between saline and ketamine treated WIS rats
at any time point during the recording (Sidak’s p > 0.88,
n.s.) (Fig. 3h). Significant sLTP was induced in all WIS
rats (5 min pre- vs. 5 min post-HFS, SAL Tukey’s p =
0.0003 and KET p < 0.0001),  and independent of the
treatment group, robust sLTP was still present 90 min
later (5 min pre- vs. 90 min post-HFS, SAL Tukey’s p =
0.028 and KET p = 0.013). This lack of effect in WIS rats
may reflect a sub-optimal ketamine dose (5 mg/kg vs.
usual 10 mg/kg), the single time point tested (3.5 h post-
ketamine) and/or a LTP ceiling effect, as the strong HFS
protocol may have elicited close to maximum levels of
LTP (i.e. saturated LTP, precluding any further drug-
induced synaptic potentiation in the control strain).
Ketamine restores long-term spatial memory in WKY rats
To further investigate the functional effects of ketamine
in this model, we sought evidence for a functional cor-
relation between SC-CA1 LTP and cognitive perform-
ance on a test of spatial memory, mediated by activity in
the dHPC [31–33]. To this end, we compared perform-
ance of WKY and WIS rats on the novel object location
recognition task (NOLRT, Fig. 4a), where preference of
60% or more for the object at the new location (NL)
during the testing session (either 1 h or 24 h after train-
ing for short or long -term memory, respectively) indi-
cates strong hippocampal-dependent spatial memory.
Total exploration time during the test session (1 h or 24
h) was comparable between the two strains (significant
ANOVA main effect of strain only, p = 0.010, but no
post-hoc pairwise significance, Sidak’s p > 0.77, n.s.) (Fig.
4b).  Importantly, in the NOLRT (significant strain by
test delay ANOVA, p < 0.047) while short-term location
recognition memory (at 1 h, Fig. 4c) in the task was
equivalent between the strains (Tukey’s p > 0.99, n.s.),
long-term memory (at 24 h, Fig. 4c) was significantly
impaired in WKY compared to WIS rats (Tukey’s p =
0.027; WKY 1 h vs. 24 h, Tukey’s p = 0.0037), consistent
with the SC-CA1 LTP deficit in these animals. Next,
while 24 h NOLRT location recognition memory
remained impaired in saline treated WKYs (vs. 24 h SAL
WIS, Tukey’s p = 0.05), ketamine significantly facilitated 
long-term object recognition memory in the WKY rat
compared to saline-treated WKYs (significant ANOVA
drug treatment main effect and strain x drug interaction,
p = 0.03 and p = 0.04; WKY 24 h SAL vs. KET, Tukey’s
p = 0.0008). Importantly, ketamine administration effect-
ively restored WKY NOLRT performance to control
WIS levels (~ 60%),  consistent with ketamine’s positive
effects on WKY dHPC synaptic plasticity. In contrast,
ketamine had no significant effects on NOLRT perform-
ance in control WIS rats (trend towards ANOVA main
effect of strain, p = 0.15, n.s., 24 h SAL vs. KET, Tukey’s
p = 0.99, n.s.) (Fig. 4c).
(2R,6R)-HNK restores normal SC-CA1 sLTP and long-term
spatial memory without affecting FST immobility in WKY
rats
Similar to ketamine, the (2R,6R)-HNK metabolite (5 mg/
kg, ip) did not have significant acute effects on SC-CA1
basal synaptic transmission in WKY rats (5 min pre-drug
vs 5 min pre-HFS, Tukey’s p = 0.99, n.s.) (Fig. 5a).  Fur-
thermore, like its parent drug, (2R,6R)-HNK also had a
pronounced facilitatory effect on WKY SC-CA1 sLTP at
3.5 h post-injection (significant drug treatment by time
ANOVA, p < 0.0088) (Fig. 5a, b).  Significant sLTP was
induced in all groups (5 min pre- vs. 5 min post-HFS,
Tukey’s p < 0.0001);  however, potentiation immediately
post-HFS was significantly enhanced in HNK compared
to saline (Sidak’s p = 0.0015) but also ketamine (p =
0.017) treated WKYs. In addition, despite significant
decay in all groups (5 min post- vs. 90 min post- HFS,
Tukey’s p ≤ 0.003), potentiation was again lost in the sa-
line group (5 min pre- vs. 90 min post-HFS, Tukey’s p =
0.75, n.s.),  while robust sLTP was still present 90 min
later in HNK-treated WKYs (5 min pre- vs. 90 min post-
HFS, Tukey’s p < 0.0001; 90 min post-HFS SAL vs. HNK,
Sidak’s p < 0.0001), which was now similar in magnitude
to that following ketamine (90 min post-HFS KET vs.
HNK, Sidak’s p = 0.93, n.s.). At the end of the recording,
7/8 (88%) of HNK-treated WKY rats still expressed ro-
bust sLTP, compared to 72% for ketamine and 21% for
saline. Consistent with these effects on synaptic plasti-
city, (2R, 6R)-HNK pre-treatment also significantly re-
stored WKY long-term (24 h) object location recognition
memory in the NOLRT (significant ANOVA effect of
drug treatment, p = 0.001) (Fig. 5c). The WKY NOLRT
long-term memory deficit (1 h vs. 24 h, Tukey’s p =
0.0037) was significantly reversed by (2R, 6R)-HNK
compared to saline (Tukey’s p = 0.012),  as previously
seen with ketamine (p = 0.0017).  Interestingly, in the
WKY strain, we failed to detect any activity of (2R,6R)-
HNK at either 30 min or 24 h after injection using the
FST (Fig. 5d) (no significant ANOVA main or inter-
action effects, p > 0.42, n.s.) or OFT (Fig. 5e) (no signifi-
cant ANOVA main or interaction effects, p > 0.45, n.s.).

Fig. 4 Ketamine restores NOLRT long-term spatial memory in WKY rats, without affecting performance in WIS controls. a In the NOLRT, following
3 days of habituation (H1–3), rats received 2 training sessions (T1 and T2, 10 min each), with two identical objects placed in two opposing arena
corners. During the testing session (T3, 1 h or 24 h later for short or long -term memory), one object stayed at the familiar location (FL), while the
other was moved to a new location (NL), where an NL preference (NL/NL + FL) of 60% or more indicates strong hippocampal-dependent spatial
memory. In experiments involving drug treatment (purple arrows), saline, ketamine or (2R,6R)-HNK were injected 3.5 h before T2, i.e. 27.5 h before
the 24 h testing session (T3). b Total NOLRT T3 exploration time (NL + FL) at 1 h or 24 h (n = 8–12/group) was comparable between the two

drug-free conditions (1 h/24 h drug-naïve: n = 8–12/strain, same rats as in (b)), short-term memory (at 1 h) was equivalent between strains;
however, long-term spatial memory (at 24 h) was significantly impaired in WKY compared to WIS rats (#p = 0.027; WKY 1 h vs. 24 h ‡ ‡p = 0.0037).
In drug-treated rats (24 h SAL/KET WKY: n = 25/group and WIS: n = 10/group), while NOLRT location recognition memory at 24 h remained
impaired in saline treated WKY compared to WIS rats (#p = 0.05), ketamine administration significantly facilitated long-term spatial memory
compared to saline-treated WKYs (***p = 0.0008), effectively restoring performance to control WIS levels (~ 60% at 24 h). Ketamine had no effect
on NOLRT performance in WIS controls. # vs. WIS = strain effect, ‡ drug-naïve 24 h vs. 1 h = time delay effect, * vs. SAL = treatment effect; *p ≤

Discussion
Recent studies have reported several abnormalities in syn-
aptic plasticity processes within key neural circuits rele-
vant to depression in the WKY model [34–40], which not
only provide support for our findings, but further high-
light the utility of this strain for the study of synaptic plas-
ticity changes and their contribution to key depressive-like
phenotypes and antidepressant responses (for review, [7]).
Overall, reductions in total hippocampal volume and im-
pairments in LTP at both medial perforant path – dentate
gyrus (mPP-DG) and SC-CA1 synapses in the stress-
prone WKY rat appear to reflect a global impairment of
hippocampal synaptic plasticity and function [35, 36, 38,
40]; however, to our knowledge, the present experiments
constitute the first systematic study of hippocampal syn-
aptic plasticity (LTD, weak and strong LTP) in this model. 
Consistent with findings from stress-based models of de-
pression, the normal balance in hippocampal synaptic
plasticity is innately perturbed in the WKY rat [7, 35, 40].
Since LTP, which facilitates spine formation/enlargement,
is significantly impaired, whereas LTD, associated with
spine shrinkage/retraction, appeared to be unaffected in
the WKY HPC, there may be a higher propensity toward
synaptic destabilization, loss of connectivity and eventu-
ally, neuronal atrophy in this key neuronal circuit impli-
cated in MDD, possibly mediating or at least contributing
to the structural and functional findings in the WKY
strain [3, 7, 11, 13, 15, 41].
On the other hand, accumulating evidence suggests
that ketamine may reverse the stress-induced impair-
ment of connectivity by engaging synaptic plasticity and
synaptogenesis to “reset the system” (for review, [7]). It

should be noted, however, that ketamine’s effects on
in vivo synaptic plasticity in the HPC and beyond, and
their direct contribution to its antidepressant action, are
still unclear. To address this, we first successfully repli-
cated ketamine’s significant rapid (30 min) and sustained
(24 h) antidepressant-like effects in both WKY and WIS
rats using the FST, the most commonly used preclinical
screen for antidepressant activity [21, 36, 42–48]. Based
on ketamine’s mechanism of action (direct NMDAR
inhibition and indirect AMPAR facilitation) and the
unique roles of NMDA and AMPA receptors in the in-
duction and expression of synaptic plasticity, respect-
ively, it is crucial to consider the temporal effects of
ketamine treatment on hippocampal LTP (i.e. both its
acute and delayed drug effects).  Importantly, we found
that ketamine acutely restored the impaired WKY SC-
CA1 LTP at 3.5 h but not 30 min after injection, with a
residual LTP facilitatory effect and an overall increase in
basal synaptic transmission at 24 h. Although the 
literature is limited in the context of the WKY model,
effective antidepressant treatments, including ketamine,
electroacupuncture or even certain protocols of elec-
trical stimulation, have now been reported to restore
dHPC LTP in this strain, thereby restoring hippocampal
memory function and reversing the associated behav-
ioural deficits in WKY rats [7, 35, 36, 38, 40]. Interest-
ingly, Belujon and Grace previously demonstrated that
ketamine restores escape behaviour, as well as LTP in
the hippocampus-accumbens pathway, in WKY rats
subjected to a learned helplessness paradigm [34].
While antidepressant doses of ketamine do not gener-
ally affect hippocampal basal transmission [49–51] as
observed here, accumulating evidence suggests that keta-
mine may selectively modulate synaptic plasticity pro-
cesses. There have been numerous, often conflicting,
reports on the effects of ketamine on synaptic plasticity
in normal outbred rats, with many studies showing acute
inhibition of hippocampal LTP [51–53] and/or LTD [49,
Page 11
Aleksandrova et al. Molecular Brain (2020) 13:92  Page 11 of 16
51, 54], effects which seem to be in line with ketamine’s
action as an open-channel NMDAR antagonist. How-
ever, importantly, others have previously reported no
change [49, 50] or even a facilitation of LTP [55–57] in
the rodent HPC following ketamine. Collectively, these
studies suffer from important inconsistencies and limita-
tions, such as utilizing mostly in vitro electrophysio-
logical recordings using hippocampal brain slices. Other
factors that may contribute to the discrepancies seen in
the literature include different doses and routes of keta-
mine administration (e.g. systemic injections of 10-100
mg/kg or bath application of 10-100 μM onto slices), dif-
ferent (often single) time points after ketamine adminis-
tration, different LTP/LTD protocols and strains of
outbred rats. Previous studies reporting LTP inhibition
following ketamine (e.g. 51–53) examined synaptic plas-
ticity under conditions where NMDARs are indeed
blocked, namely post-administration with drug on board
and/or after relatively high doses of ketamine (10-100
mg/kg or 10-100 μM versus 5 mg/kg in the present
study).  Importantly, these doses often greatly exceed
peak antidepressant ketamine doses/concentrations re-
ported in the context of depression (< 1 μM in humans
following 0.5 mg/kg, IV or ~ 5 μM in mice after 10 mg/
kg, ip [21, 58]).
Under our experimental design, ketamine may have
failed to affect sLTP in control WIS rats, due to a sub-
optimal ketamine dose (5 mg/kg vs. > 10 mg/kg in the
literature),  the single time point tested (3.5 h post-
ketamine) and/or a ceiling effect (i.e. nearly saturated
LTP induced by the strong HFS protocol).  Although
additional studies are needed to better characterize the
effect of ketamine (e.g. 5-10 mg/kg at 30 min-days post-
injection) on LTP in outbred rats, accumulating data in-
dicate that ketamine can facilitate non-saturated LTP at
lower doses and/or longer post-injection delays in rat
strains other than inbred WKY rats. Specifically, two
previous studies confirm that ketamine (3–10 mg/kg, IV)
enhances SC-CA1 fEPSP wLTP following sub-maximal
HFS in hippocampal slices obtained from normal out-
bred rats at 24 h post-injection [55, 56],  similar to our
observations in stress-prone WKY rats. Moreover, one
study found that chronic social defeat stress applied to
mice impairs SC-CA1 LTP in vitro, which was reversed
by ketamine (5 mg/kg, ip) at 24 h post-injection [57].
Clearly, as indicated by the present study, there is a need
for systematic investigations of ketamine’s effects on
in vivo hippocampal synaptic plasticity at therapeutically
relevant doses, at appropriate post-injection intervals
and in the context of valid preclinical models of
depression.
Initially, ketamine’s action as an antidepressant was
simply attributed to an acute blockade of the NMDA re-
ceptor, giving rise to the NMDAR inhibition hypothesis 
of ketamine’s effects on depression. This hypothesis, in
turn, prompted the evaluation of alternative NMDAR
antagonists as novel, safer antidepressants. Disappoint-
ingly, human clinical trials failed to confirm that alterna-
tive NMDAR blockers (e.g. memantine, AZD6765 and
CP-101,606) shared ketamine’s robust, rapid and/or sus-
tained antidepressant effects. Indeed, to date, ketamine
is the only NMDAR antagonist to consistently demon-
strate antidepressant efficacy in multiple trials [21, 59,
60].  Preclinical studies also report that treatment with
the NMDAR antagonists MK-801 and memantine,
which bind to the same receptor site as ketamine, lack
sustained antidepressant effects in rodents [21, 61]. Sub-
unit composition of heteromeric NMDARs, namely the
presence of GluN2A versus GluN2B subunits, is another
important consideration. Specifically, low doses of keta-
mine have been proposed to selectively block GluN2B-
containing NMDARs that may be 1) tonically activated
by spontaneously released and/or ambient glutamate,
and 2) mainly extra-synaptic and potentially more ac-
cessible to exogenous antagonism [62–65]. Higher doses
of ketamine may gradually inhibit synaptic NMDARs
containing more GluN2A subunits involved in the in-
duction of LTP, thereby mediating the acute inhibitory
effect of ketamine on LTP [62]. This body of work has
prompted the hypothesis that while ketamine is non-
subunit specific, antagonism of GluN2B-containing
NMDARs might be responsible for its antidepressant ac-
tion [62, 63, 66].  In partial support of this conjecture,
the selective GluN2B antagonist, Ro25–698 possesses
rapid antidepressant action in rodents; however, the ef-
fects appear to be less robust and/or shorter-lasting
compared to ketamine [21, 61, 67–69]. Finally, while ini-
tial clinical studies usually employed the racemic form of
ketamine, the enantiomer R-ketamine, which is ~ 4
times less potent at inhibiting NMDAR than S-ketamine,
has a more potent and sustained antidepressant action
in rodents [60, 70].  Overall, the differential clinical ac-
tion of NMDAR blockers can be attributed to a broad
range of factors related to NMDAR antagonism, such as
specificity in terms of receptor subunit and localization,
extent/nature of channel block including drug affinity,
trapping, receptor state dependence, competitive/non-
competitive properties, etc., as well as the unique down-
stream effects of the acute drug-receptor interaction
[19]. Unlike other members of this drug class, ketamine
is a non-competitive, open-channel antagonist, which
binds to the NMDAR with a low affinity and high but
not complete trapping (86%), and is uniquely associated
with the induction of long-lasting, NMDAR inhibition-
dependent synaptic plasticity thought to underlie its
robust and sustained antidepressant effects [19, 21, 63].
It is becoming increasingly clear that it is crucial to
consider not only ketamine’s unique acute action on thePage 12
Aleksandrova et al. Molecular Brain (2020) 13:92  Page 12 of 16
NMDA receptor, but also the key downstream signaling
events as a result of ketamine-induced NMDAR inhib-
ition (e.g. suppression of eukaryotic elongation factor 2
(eEF2)-mediated protein synthesis and recruitment of
BDNF- and mTOR- dependent synaptogenic pathways),
effects which develop over time and are not observed
with alternative NMDAR antagonists lacking antidepres-
sant properties [19, 21, 63].  While the specific mecha-
nisms underlying ketamine’s facilitatory effects on LTP
observed here remain unknown, many factors must be
considered given ketamine’s unique abilities to modulate
specific NMDAR and AMPA receptor subtypes, release
of glutamate and monoamines, along with effects on ex-
pression of key post-synaptic proteins involved in the
regulation of synaptic plasticity (for review, see [7]). One
possible mechanism that deserves particular consider-
ation is the atypical protein kinase C isoform, protein
kinase Mζ (PKMζ), which plays an essential role in LTP
maintenance and memory retention in various brain re-
gions, including the HPC [31–33]. Previous studies have
revealed the regulatory effects of PKMζ on the expres-
sion and localization of synaptic proteins, especially
AMPARs, which ultimately counteract the active decay
of LTP and maintain synaptic potentiation and memory
retention [31–33]. Interestingly, a recent study reported
that chronic mild stress increased depressive-like and
anxiety-like behaviors, decreased the expression of
PKMζ in the rodent mPFC and HPC, and induced syn-
aptic deficits that were reversed or mimicked by PKMζ
overexpression or inhibition, respectively [71].  Import-
antly, PKMζ synthesis is regulated by multiple kinases
implicated in ketamine’s actions, including mTOR, and
to complete this intriguing sequence, mPFC PKMζ ex-
pression is increased by antidepressant doses of keta-
mine [71].  Accordingly, PKMζ  warrants further
investigation as a  potential critical mediator of
depressive-like behavior, synaptic plasticity across differ-
ent brain regions and antidepressant effects of novel
drugs including ketamine [71].
As mentioned, previous work highlights the critical
role of dHPC LTP in long-term spatial memory persist-
ence and its decay, induced by experimental reduction
of synaptic expression of AMPARs [31–33]. This forget-
ting process, which actively erases consolidated long-
term memories in the HPC and other brain structures, is
normally tightly regulated and contributes to establish-
ing adaptive behavior. Importantly, this cognitive func-
tion may be dysregulated in the context of
neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, promot-
ing the associated decline of memory and cognition [14,
31–33]. Accordingly, we examined whether the impaired
SC-CA1 LTP observed in WKY rats may be associated
with accelerated the forgetting of long-term spatial
memory, and if so, whether this cognitive deficit may be 
rescued by ketamine. Consistent with the SC-CA1 LTP
deficit and corresponding positive effects of ketamine,
WKY rats exhibited a selective deficit in hippocampal-
dependent long-term spatial memory (as measured by
the NOLRT at a delay of 24 h),  and importantly, this
striking deficit was effectively eliminated by ketamine
pre-treatment. Accordingly, our results indicate that by
restoring sLTP in stress-prone WKYs, ketamine treat-
ment rescued a long-term object location memory def-
icit reminiscent of certain cognitive impairments that
are a key feature of depression.
It is well established that stress, including learned
helplessness, chronic mild stress, chronic social defeat or
even aging, can impair hippocampal LTP in outbred rats,
which in turn is associated with various cognitive im-
pairments, including spatial memory deficits, in addition
to other depressive-like phenotypes [72–78].  Although
assessment of cognitive/memory function in the WKY
rat model of depression is sparse, available reports indi-
cate significant impairments in spatial and object recog-
nition memory in this strain [40, 79–81].  We have
argued that the stress-induced dysregulation of hippo-
campal synaptic plasticity and associated memory pro-
cesses may be an innate characteristic of the WKY
model [7], which can be effectively eliminated by keta-
mine as observed here. Interestingly, in WKY rats, elec-
troacupuncture exerts antidepressant-like activity in the
FST, while also restoring in vitro SC-CA1 LTP and
HPC-dependent spatial memory [40].  Similarly, various
pharmacological and environmental interventions (e.g.
GLYX-13/rapastinel and environmental enrichment) re-
verse stress-induced deficits in hippocampal LTP and as-
sociated spatial memory in outbred rats [77, 78, 82–85].
Together these many and varied findings strengthen the
link between hippocampal synaptic plasticity and mem-
ory dysfunction in the context of stress/depression.
In common with its parent drug, we show (2R,6R)-
HNK (5 mg/kg, ip) also effectively restored normal
SC-CA1 sLTP in WKY rats at 3.5 h post-injection.
HNK induces rapid and sustained enhancement of
AMPAR function via a mechanism that does not in-
volve NMDAR inhibition (for review, [19]).  Import-
antly. current findings with the WKY model indicate
that the effects of both ketamine and its metabolite
are mediated by selective modulation of metaplasticity
processes (i.e.,  the activity-dependent modulation of
subsequently induced synaptic plasticity, in this case,
LTP),  without affecting basal synaptic transmission.
Consistent with its positive effects on SC-CA1 LTP,
in the present study, (2R,6R)-HNK also rescued
hippocampal-dependent long-term object location
memory in WKYs. Interestingly, (2R,6R)-HNK failed
to reverse the FST deficit in WKY rats. As discussed,
there are conflicting preclinical reports about the
Page 13
Aleksandrova et al. Molecular Brain (2020) 13:92  Page 13 of 16
antidepressant efficacy of HNK (at 10 mg/kg, ip) [21–
25].  It is possible that the metabolite did not affect
FST immobility in our study because the WKY rat
represents a  relatively severe, treatment-resistant
model of depression [7],  although positive effects at
higher doses (> 5 mg/kg) and/or in more valid preclin-
ical tests of depression cannot be ruled out in the
context of the WKY model. Based on our findings
and those of others [19, 21–25],  it appears that at
equivalent doses, (2R,6R)-HNK recapitulates some,
but not all, aspects of ketamine’s molecular and anti-
depressant effects. Accordingly, consideration should
be given to more precise dissection of mechanistic
points of overlap and divergence in the actions of
ketamine and this key active metabolite.
The observation that (2R,6R)-HNK failed to decrease
FST immobility in WKY rats despite restoring SC-CA1
LTP, raises important questions about the role of LTP at
this synapse in accounting for the effects of antidepres-
sants in the FST. Based on these findings, we propose
that in the WKY model of depression, pharmacological
restoration of dHPC synaptic plasticity does not underlie
ketamine’s effects in the FST. Instead, we propose that
the common ability of both ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK
to restore SC-CA1 LTP mediates reversal of
hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits, such as
spatial memory, which are also key features of clinical
depression. Overall, our results highlight the potential
pro-cognitive action of ketamine and HNK in the con-
text of depression, as well as the role of hippocampal
synaptic plasticity in the development and reversal of
certain, more cognitive, depressive-like phenotypes.
Clinical studies report that hippocampal volume loss
in depression predicts illness duration and severity, and
is associated with well-documented cognitive deficits
and poorer clinical outcomes [1, 4, 14, 15, 36, 86–90].
Therefore, a pronounced hippocampal deficit, as in the
case of both WKY rats and patients suffering from mood
and anxiety disorders, can result in impairments in
various aspects of hippocampal-dependent learning,
rendering an individual more vulnerable to developing
symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, as well as con-
tributing to the complex cognitive deficits observed in
depression [1, 4, 14, 15, 36, 86–89, 91]. Given that sub-
stantial aspects of the burden of depression are attrib-
uted to these cognitive impairments, their effective
treatment by novel antidepressants such as ketamine
and related compounds holds promise of improved
long-term outcomes and functional recovery [92].
Concern has been raised that ketamine, at high con-
centrations and/or repeated schedules of administration,
or when the drug is on board during task performance,
may impair hippocampal function and/or have non-
specific side effects (e.g. attentional, sensory-motor, etc.), 
subsequently disrupting spatial learning and memory
[93–101].  Indeed, mild and transient psychotomimetic
side effects and cognitive deficits are commonly reported
in the clinic during and shortly after ketamine infusion.
However, when doses and time points are selected to en-
sure ketamine has positive effects on hippocampal syn-
aptic plasticity and function, especially in the context of
models of hippocampal dysfunction (e.g. WKYs,
stressed/aged outbred rats),  then ketamine treatment
may have pro-cognitive effects, as observed here. Con-
sistent with this, positive effects of low-dose ketamine
on cognitive function in rodents are numerous [12, 44,
102, 103],  with one study, for example, reporting that
ketamine (5 mg/kg, ip) can restore SC-CA1 LTP and as-
sociated spatial working memory at 24 h in mice sub-
jected to chronic social defeat [57]. Importantly, recent
clinical trials indicate that ketamine’s sustained anti-
depressant effects in TRD patients appear to be accom-
panied by significant improvements in cognitive
function, highlighting a promising future research av-
enue [104–106].
Although ketamine’s ability to restore hippocampal-
dependent function by modulating synaptic plasticity is
a plausible mechanism for some of its therapeutic effects
related to functions mediated by the dHPC, it is highly
unlikely that such localized effects can account for keta-
mine’s wide range of antidepressant effects. Indeed, it is
becoming increasingly clear that ketamine has unique ef-
fects on multiple neural circuits implicated in depression
that likely mediate different aspects of its antidepressant
activity [7].. In summary, dHPC synaptic plasticity may
represent a neural substrate for ketamine’s effects on
more cognitive, hippocampal-dependent functions,
whereas other circuits (e.g. ventral HPC, PFC, amygdala,
mesolimbic system) likely mediate positive treatment ef-
fects on other facets relevant to depression, including
stress coping, anhedonia and emotional dysregulation.
Based on experience gained from the present study,
we recommend several strategies to better understand
the neural bases and unique clinical properties of novel,
rapid-acting antidepressants. The first approach involves
greater reliance on animal models of heightened stress
susceptibility and resistance to conventional antidepres-
sant drugs (e.g. the WKY rat), in order to increase the
relevance for vulnerable and treatment-resistant popula-
tions. Next, we emphasize the importance of decon-
structing different depression-like phenotypes and
corresponding antidepressant responses by utilizing
more comprehensive batteries of preclinical tests across
various domains affected in MDD (e.g. stress/emotional
reactivity, motivation and cognition). Moving beyond an
over-reliance on predictive tests such as the FST, more
precise and reliable measures of specific aspects of
depression permit better identification of the neural
Page 14

circuits mediating the development and reversal of spe-
cific behavioural phenotypes of interest. This continued
effort to redefine clinical symptoms of depression in
terms of brain circuit dysfunctions will enhance our
understanding of the pathophysiology underlying various
symptoms of depression, and may provide novel stra-
tegies for enhancing antidepressant efficacy and select-
ively targeting different symptoms/endophenotypes of
MDD.
