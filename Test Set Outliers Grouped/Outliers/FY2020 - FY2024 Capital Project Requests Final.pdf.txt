The Framingham Public Library takes prides in promoting digital literacy and in providing equal
access to computer workstations for all members of the community. The public uses Library
technology for work, research, hobbies and play. They engage in tasks like genealogy
exploration, college preparation, citizenship training, resume building, gaming, and much more. 
The Library is able to offer the use of business grade software and internet access at no cost to
the public. However, we are woefully out of date. The average lifespan of a desktop computer is
estimated to be around four years. Some of our PCs date back to 2008. Out of the 186 PCs that
the Library owns, 125 are at least five years old. Because some of these machines are obsolete, 
they tend to incur costly and time consuming repairs. In order to best serve our community, we
want to update our technology infrastructure by replacing obsolete PCs and upgrading the
operating systems and software in all of our computers and servers.
These funds will be used to purchase a F450 4x4 Crew Cab Dump Truck to replace Truck 15
within the Division's fleet, a 2001 Ford F250 Extended Cab Pickup Truck with 83,278 miles, 
equating to 124,917 engine miles.There are 21 trucks within the Parks Maintenance

The Memorial Building roof is leaking in the front of the main hall and the Veterans memorial. 
The repairs for this area is needed to prevent extensive damage and the roof coating on Nevins
Hall is almost gone and if not recoated the damage will be to the point of will needing to be
reroofed. The feasibility study is to provide an assessment of the space requirements for the City
and the evaluation of our parking needs and assessment of current parking facilities.
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital Funding for
the Walsh Athletic Fields Renovation, Phase II project. Currently, the Lower Walsh Complex
offers an unlined, failing 6-lane track; undersized center field in poor condition; full sized softball
field in poor condition; poor drainage and stormwater management; and a lack of accessibility to
the site. Because of these conditions, the overall usage of the site has greatly decreased to a
point where the field is only utilized in certain situations where other locations are completely
booked.
This project will provide funds to assist with compliance with new National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit
year 2 requirements. Deliverables will include: develop or revise ordinance, regulation, 
permitting, plan review, inspection, and catchment investigation procedures; develop or revise
operations and maintenance procedures for City-owned parks and open space, buildings and
facilities, vehicles and equipment, and stormwater treatment structures; and develop an
inventory of potential retrofits at City-owned property or facilities to improve water quality. 
Deliverables from this project will be incorporated into the City’s Stormwater Management Plan
and annual report to the EPA.

This project is a continuance of the City’s ongoing phased investigations, repair, and
rehabilitation of the wastewater collection system, which will assess the overall condition of
pipelines and manholes in a sixth area of the City, identify sources of extraneous flows
(infiltration and inflow) to the system, and recommend repairs and improvements. The work will
include: flow monitoring, field investigations, closed circuit televising, condition scoring of
pipelines and manholes, inspections of private properties to identify and eliminate illegal
connections such as sump pumps, roof leaders, and roof drains, and development of a capital
improvement plan to address identified system defects.
This appropriation provides funding for the DPW to perform systematic improvements and
repairs to sewer mains and manholes and to respond to unanticipated sewer system failures. 
Work may include the elimination of illegal connections and other capital projects which will
reduce extraneous flows within the collection system.
This appropriation will provide for the replacement and upgrades of equipment at older
wastewater pumping stations, including planned and emergency replacement of components
such as pumps, motors, controls and other ancillary equipment.

The City has been improving subsurface utilities along Union Avenue from downtown to
Buckminster Square since 2016, in preparation for a MADOT funded Complete Streets roadway
project that is scheduled to start construction in 2021. Construction on two Union Avenue utilities
projects included removing concrete road base in order to then replace or repair sewer, water
and stormwater infrastructure from Buckminster Square to Beech Street, with related work on
many adjacent streets. This project addresses the remaining drainage, sewer and water updates
needed on Henry, and Pearl and adjacent Sstreets, as well as in Union Avenue between Beech
and Proctor Streets, and the drainage pipe crossing CSX property to the outfall at Farm Pond.

This project was deferred from FY2018 and FY2019, and will perform the investigation and
design of the replacement and/or rehabilitation of aged sewer mains located in the Central
Street corridor, between Highgate Road and Purchase Street. The existing sewer has sections
that cross private properties, including sections immediately alongside and in the shoreline of the
Sudbury River, and a goal of this project is to relocate the sewer to be in the road right-of-way
for improved maintenance access, if and where cost effective. Investigation of tributary sewer
mains will also be performed to identify defects, infiltration and inflow, and sections of asbestos
cement pipe (ACP). This work would be done in concert with a previously authorized project to
design the Central Street water main repair, replacement and/or improvement.
This project was deferred from the FY2019 requests, and this study and design is expected to
result in the elimination of 2 small and outdated pump stations (Flanagan and McQuinn) via
deep gravity sewers, and the needed improvements to the downstream Pleasant Street station, 
as well as the replacement or lining of 2 miles of sewer, and the removal of 1,100 feet of
asbestos cement pipe (ACP).
This work will continue implementation of “No Dig” lining repairs (aka trenchless), extending into
the area between Waverly Street and Worcester Road as well as areas east of Concord Street. 
Phase 3 will include a coordinated plan to complete pipeline dig and replace repairs not
addressed in the Phase 1 and 2 areas, continue to address sewer main and manhole defects
between Waverly Street and Worcester Road, and address defects identified in areas in the
easterly part of the City in the vicinity of Concord Street.

This project was deferred from the FY2018 and FY2019 requests, and is for neighborhood-wide
concept design, final design of a first phase of construction, and 60% design of a second phase, 
which will begin neighborhood and property owner consultation; refine, validate and document
project criteria; and identify detailed construction costs and next steps.
The proposed work will construct water and sewer systems replacements and rehabilitation prior
to the future final design and construction of intersection geometric improvements, sidewalks, 
and installation of a traffic signal via State TIP funding.
This is for the initial study, and subsequent design and bid documents for a replacement of the
sewer pump station at Garvey Road. Other adjacent and nearby City infrastructure, such as
sewers, water mains, drainage systems and roadway, will be reviewed to determine if repairs, 
replacement or improvements are cost effective to implement at the same time as the pump
station replacement.

The Framingham Public Library would like to create additional parking between the existing
McAuliffe Branch Library parking lot and the Nobscot Plaza property. Over the past two-years, 
staff at the McAuliffe Branch Library have fielded many complaints over the inadequate amount
of parking spaces in the Library’s parking lot. So many complaints were lodged, in fact, that
library administration requested that staff park in the Plaza parking area, freeing up about 10
additional spaces library patrons. Nonetheless, it’s not uncommon for the library parking lot to
reach capacity, especially during library programs. This means that patrons park in the apron, 
which has resulted in fender benders, or they spill over into the Plaza lot with the staff.

the Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; II – Westbound lanes; III – north-south sewer connector), with this request
for the construction of Phase I, and the final design of II and III.
This appropriation will provide for the replacement and upgrades of equipment at older wastewater pumping stations. 
The project includes the planned replacement of pumps, motors, controls and others, as well as emergency
replacements.
Upgrade within the limits of the water project. SSES found significant deficiencies
Perform physical monitoring to assess system flow trends, particularly reductions due to infiltration and inflow
reductions. Envisioned in 2017 as a triennial effort, initiating in FY21 due to other urgent priorities, including the
related next SSES reports, and (High Priority) Sewer Defects Repairs Phase 1-3, et al.

$375,000 2021 The Hemenway Road Sewer Improvements is a project associated with the upgrade of the wastewater collection
system. The Hemenway Road Sewer Improvements will provide funds for the design and construction of the
replacement of 1,700 linear feet of gravity sewer on Hemenway Road.
$50,000 2021 This project provides funds for the final design and implementation of a construction project to formally abandon the
Saxonville wastewater pumping station force mains. The existing pipe lines are over 12,000 feet in length and
composed of various materials including CI, DI, and AC. They range in diameter from 12-inch to 24-inch. They are
located under rights-of-way and within easements located within Framingham. The routine abandonment process
will include accessing the pipe at regular locations along the pipe and filling with a material that will prevent the pipe
from collapsing due to corrosion. Other methods of abandonment will include bulk-heading the pipe at locations
along the route to prevent the migration of groundwater and soil in the pipe. Easement work and coordination with
Natick is required to complete this work. Limited surface restoration will be required along the pipe route.

This project will provide funds for the design and construction of the restoration of a section of Hop Brook west of the
Hemenway Road and the CSX rail line. The project was originally identified through the Phase 3 Stormwater Master
Plan and will include the removal of the Landham Pond Dam and related improvements in Hop Brook to support the
removal of the dam. The proposed improvements include the removal of the dam, removal/adjustments to existing
sediments and fill materials, and habitat restoration. The project is largely located within Town-owned areas, but
access easement(s) may be required. Design activities will include survey and hydraulic modeling to assure that the
improvements provide benefits.
This funding provides ongoing roadway, curb, sidewalk and related infrastructure rehabilitation and improvements
necessary to retain an overall State of Good Repair citywide, as well as safety and accessibility improvements. The
majority of this work provides roadway resurfacing such as mill and overlay, stress absorbing membrane interlayer, 
bonded wearing course, rubber chip seal, mill and fill and crack sealing.
This project will provide funds for the continued study of the Town’s stormwater system. Five of the Town’s twenty-
two sub-basins will be studied as part of this project. This project includes a study of the North and South Saxonville, 
Cherry Meadow Brook, Birch Meadow Brook and Baiting Brook drainage sub-basins. The systems will receive
condition assessment of the infrastructure, hydraulic modeling of known flooding areas, and review for water quality
improvements, including sediment management and control. The project will then develop specific recommendations
for improvements to the system.
Design and implement web-based system to identify drainage assets during cleaning operations and then document
status and condition
Annual Appropriation for DPW capital repairs to the stormwater conveyance system. Improvements include removal
of debris and sedimentation restoration of channel bottoms. Includes repairs to side walls, banks and channel
formed channel bases. Improvements will restore system capacity and mitigate flooding.

$1,000,000 2022 This project will provide funds for design of roadway improvements to the Butterworth Park area. When constructed
the project will provide roadway pavement rehabilitation (milling and/or reclamation) with the objective of reducing
excess pavement width where possible; new and reset granite curbing, replacement of existing sidewalks and
construction of new sidewalks and driveway aprons; and replacement or repair of existing drainage structures and
piping as required. ADA-compliant sidewalks and wheelchair ramps will be constructed. In addition, streetscape and
lighting improvements will be incorporated at the same time which would result in savings as opposed to
implementation at separate times.

The majority of schools have the same furniture that was purchased during their construction in the sixties. Although
there are many pieces of relatively new furniture in the schools, there is no way to refurbish the 255 classrooms that
still use outdated furniture. Current teaching methods and modern technology in the elementary and middle school
grades require the use of laptop and other devices.

$3,000,000 2023 This sewer improvement is required for the undersized and aged line serving Tech Park, 9/90 and other areas, with
increased capacity to allow planned growth in the Tech Park and 9/90 areas. Subsurface investigation and detailed
design revealed that specialty construction methods are needed to provide the additional capacity and to reduce
construction risks, particularly where it needs to cross under I-90 and the CSX railroad, as well as to reduce impacts
to residents and businesses.
$27,500 2023 
The original design was for installation of a 24-inch pipe to provide an additional 3 million gallons per day (MGD), with
5,000 linear feet (LF) of open cut mostly through residential neighborhoods, and two short sections of pipe jacking
under the highway and railroad. The pipe size has been further increased to 30 inches, providing an additional 5
MGD of capacity, and was realigned to be mostly along the CSX line. To optimally manage risks during and after
construction, with the soils and groundwater conditions found during subsurface investigation, the proposed methods
of construction now includes approximately 2,500 LF of micro-tunneling and auger boring, and 2,500 LF of open cut. 
These changes increase the project cost by $2.8 million, though value engineering reduced that by approximately
$0.75 million, and therefore, $2.1 million is requested in additional funding.

The majority of schools have the same furniture that was purchased during their construction in the sixties. Although
there are many pieces of relatively new furniture in the schools, there is no way to refurbish the 255 classrooms that
still use outdated furniture. Current teaching methods and modern technology in the elementary and middle school
grades require the use of laptop and other devices. The plan is to begin with one elementary school (25 classrooms) 
and 10 grade offices per year until all furniture has been replaced as necessary.

reductions. Envisioned in 2017 as a triennial effort, initiating in FY21 due to other urgent priorities, including the
related next SSES reports, and (High Priority) Sewer Defects Repairs Phase 1-3, et al.
This project includes the design of sewer improvements on Edgell Road from Central Street to the Edmands/Water
Intersection in advance of roadway improvements. The project includes rehabilitation or replacement of 8,200 feet of
8-inch asbestos cement pipe gravity main, and 1,200 feet of force main (the rest of which is being improved as part of
the Woodland Force Main project). The project will also evaluate replacement of 5,500 feet of vitrified clay drain line, 
which is likely to be damaged during construction. The project will provide a survey, borings, and geotechnical
analyses sufficient for roadway improvements. The project will also include all permitting and access requirements.
Replace pump station and force main.
