PHOTOGRAPH/VIDEO OPT-OUT FORM
(PARENTS: Complete and return this form only if you do NOT give permission for your
student’s image to appear in possible school publications, including postings on the website, in
district promotional activities, or in student yearbooks.)
During the course of the school year, photographs or videos of students are taken during the
school day and at activities for use in district and educational news releases, publications, video
productions, social media, educational projects, and the district website. 
Pursuant to Board Policy 515 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, (FERPA), the
School District has designated photographs and videos of students as “limited directory
information” that may be released and published only for the following purposes: use by the
District in official publications, promotional materials, or on the District website; use in an
officially sanctioned school yearbook; or use as part of a District event. 
If you do NOT wish to have photographs or videos of your students released for these limited
purposes, you must sign and return this form to be kept on file for one year. You will be asked to
fill out a new form each school year if you do not want your child’s image published. 
Please note that if your student participates in public events (such as a sporting event or drama
production that is open to the community) the school/district may have little or no control over
photographs taken by media, other parents or community members attending the event. Students
18 years of age do not require parental consent for photo use. 
No, I do not give my permission for St. Cloud Area School District 742, authorized partners or media to
use photos or videos of my child for school purposes, other than as outlined above.
