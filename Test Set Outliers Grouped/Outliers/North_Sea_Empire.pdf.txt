North Sea Empire
North Sea Empire and Anglo-Scandinavian Empire are
terms used by historians to refer to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union"] personal union of the
kingdoms of England, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"] Denmark[a] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"] Norway for most of
the period between 1013 and 1042 towards the end of the
 Viking Age.[1] This ephemeral Norse-ruled empire was a
thalassocracy, its components only connected by and
dependent upon the sea.[2]
 The first king to unite all three kingdoms was Sweyn
Forkbeard, king of Denmark since 986 and of Norway since
1000, when he conquered England in 1013. He died the
 following year and his realm was divided. His son Cnut the
Great acquired England in 1016, Denmark in 1018 and
Norway in 1028. He died in 1035 and his realm was again
divided, but his successor in Denmark, Harthacnut, inherited
England in 1040 and ruled it until his death. At the height of
his power, when Cnut ruled all three kingdoms (1028–1035),
he was the most powerful ruler in western Europe after the
 Holy Roman Emperor.[b]

 However, the invasion fell apart: the men of the Kingdom of

raid, were not ready before the English nobles had reinstalled
King Æthelred, whom they had previously sent into exile,
after forcing him to agree to govern less harshly.[4]

 Southampton and swore fealty to Cnut. Cnut blockaded
London, but was forced to leave to replenish his supplies and
was beaten by Edmund at the Battle of Otford; however,
following the Danes as they raided into Essex, Edmund was

struck an agreement under which Edmund would retain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wessex"] Wessex and Cnut rule all of England north of the
Thames. But on 30 November 1016, Edmund in turn died, leaving Cnut as King of England.[5]
In summer 1017 he cemented his power by marrying Æthelred's widow, Emma, although he had
previously married an English noblewoman, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86lfgifu_of_Northampton"] Ælfgifu of Northampton.[6] In 1018 he paid off his fleet (with
money especially from the citizens of London) and was fully recognised as King of England.[7]
Denmark 
King Harald died childless in 1018 or 1019, leaving the country without a
king. Cnut was his brother's heir and went to Denmark in 1019 to claim it.
While there he sent his subjects in England a letter saying he was abroad to
avert an unspecified "danger",[8] and he only returned to quell incipient
rebellions.[9] One Danish chronicle states that the Danes had previously
deposed Harald in favour of Cnut, then brought back Harald because of Cnut's
frequent absences, until Cnut finally became king permanently after his
brother's death.[10]
King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_II_of_Norway"] Olaf II of Norway and King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anund_Jacob_of_Sweden"] Anund Jacob of Sweden, seeing the
Cnut the Great  combined Anglo-Danish kingdom as a threat – Cnut's father Sweyn had
asserted power over both their countries – took advantage of Cnut's being in
England to attack Denmark in 1025 or 1026, and were joined by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulf_Jarl"] Ulf Jarl,
Cnut's Danish regent, and his brother. Cnut took Olaf's fleet by surprise and took the battle to the Swedish
fleet at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Helge%C3%A5"] Battle of the Helgeå.[11] The precise outcome is disputed, but Cnut came out best; Olaf fled and
the threat to Denmark was dispelled.[12][13]
Page 3
In 1027, Cnut travelled to Rome, partly to expiate his sin for having Jarl Ulf killed the previous Christmas,
partly to attend the coronation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor"] Conrad II as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor"] Holy Roman Emperor and to demonstrate his importance as
a ruler. He secured relaxation of tolls levied on pilgrims journeying to Rome from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"] Northern Europe, and on
Papal fees for English archbishops receiving their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallium"] pallium; he also began a relationship with Conrad that
led to the Emperor's son [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor"] Henry marrying Cnut's daughter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunhilda_of_Denmark"] Gunnhild and before that to the Emperor ceding
to Denmark [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Schleswig"] Schleswig and a strip of ancient Danish territory between Hedeby and the Eider that the
Germans had occupied as a buffer zone against the Danes.[14][15]
Norway
 Olaf II had extended his power throughout Norway while Jarl Erik was with Cnut in England.[16] Cnut's
enmity with him extended further back: Æthelred had returned to England in a fleet provided by Olaf.[17]
In 1024 Cnut had offered to let Olaf govern Norway as his vassal;[18] but after Helgeå, he set about
undermining his unpopular rule with bribes, and in 1028 set out with 50 ships to subjugate Norway. A
large contingent of Danish ships joined him, and Olaf withdrew into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Fjord"] Oslo Fjord while Cnut sailed along
the coast, landing at various points and receiving oaths of allegiance from the local chieftains. Finally at
Nidaros, now Trondheim, he was acclaimed king at the Eyrathing, and in a few months Olaf fled to
Sweden.[19][20][21]
In 1030, Olaf attempted to return, but the people of the Trondheim area did not want him back and he was
defeated and killed at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stiklestad"] Battle of Stiklestad.
Parts of Sweden
After Helgeå, Cnut also claimed to rule "part of Sweden" together with England, Denmark, and
Norway.[22] He had coins minted either in the capital, Sigtuna, or in Lund, then part of Denmark, with the
inscription CNVT REX SW ("Cnut King of the Swedes"). [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A4sterg%C3%B6tland"] Western Geatland or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blekinge"] Blekinge have been
suggested.[23] Most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_runestones"] England runestones are in Uppland. It was probably either overlordship or disputed
rule; Cnut did not have to be present in Sweden to order the minting of coins, coins were also minted
asserting he ruled Ireland,[24][25] Irish Coinage. and Swedish history at this early date is very uncertain.[26]
Also, Anglo-Saxon sources state [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anund_Jakob"] Anund Jakob won the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Helge%C3%A5"] Battle of Helgeå.[27] If the Danes controlled
Sweden they did only control Svealand for a maximum of 3 years before Anund ousted Cnut. In 1030
Anund is again in firm control according to sources of Sweden. Since Anund Jakob decided on bishops for
all of Sweden 1030 in Adam of Bremens source. Adam does not mention a Danish conquest in his
description of Anunds reign 1030. Rather [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anund_Jakob"] Anund Jakob and Sweden militarily supported Olaf the second
in his attempts to regain the Norwegian throne from Cnut 1030. [28] [29]
Tributary areas
In addition to part of Sweden, of which he or the person who wrote the heading to his letter claimed he was
king part of, Cnut received tribute from the Wends and was allied with the Poles; in 1022, together with
 Godwin and Ulf Jarl, he took a fleet east into the Baltic to confirm his overlordship of the coastal areas that
the Danish kings dominated from Jomsborg.[30]
Immediately after his return from Rome, Cnut led an army into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"] Scotland and made vassals of Malcolm, the
high king of Scotland, and two other kings,[31] one of whom, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echmarcach_mac_Ragnaill"] Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, was a sea-king
whose lands included [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galloway"] Galloway and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man"] Isle of Man and would become [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Dublin"] king of Dublin in 1036. All these
and likely also the Welsh[32] paid tribute, on the model of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danegeld"] Danegeld that Æthelred had instituted to pay
Page 4
off the Danes; and Cnut was thus reasserting the dominion over the
Celtic kingdoms that recent English kings had had to let lapse, as
well as punishing those who had supported Olaf against him.[18] A
verse by the Icelandic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skald"] skald [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93ttarr_svarti"] Óttarr svarti calls Cnut "king of the
Danes, the Irish, the English and the Islanders";  presumably
Norway is omitted because Cnut had not yet come to power
there.[33]
Religion 
North Sea Empire. Red: Countries
By the early 11th century, England had been Christian for where Cnut was king. Orange:
centuries; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelaw"] Danelaw was in transition from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse_religion"] paganism to  vassals. Yellow: allies.
Christianity,[34] but the Scandinavian countries were still
predominantly pagan.[35] Cnut's father, Sweyn, had initially been
pagan but in later life had been basically Christian.[36] In England, Cnut assiduously promoted the interests
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism"] the Church, and this brought him acceptance from the Christian rulers of Europe that no other
Scandinavian king had previously been accorded.[37] In Norway, in contrast, he built churches and was
both respectful and generous to the clergy, but also made allies of the heathen chieftains, and unlike Olaf,
did not make laws benefitting the Church until his power was on a solid footing.[18]
Governance
Earldoms of England c.
1025 
Early in 1017, probably because he was
king by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_conquest"] right of conquest not more normal
means, Cnut divided England into 4
 earldoms on the Scandinavian model:
 Wessex he governed directly, and of his
 allies Thorkell the Tall became Earl of East Penny of Cnut the Great
Anglia, Eric Haakonsson retained
Northumbria, which Cnut had already given him, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadric_Streona"] Eadric Streona
became [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Mercia"] Earl of Mercia. But the last was disgraced and executed within a
year. In 1018 Cnut revived at least two earldoms in Wessex and at a
meeting at Oxford, his followers and representatives of the English agreed
that he would govern under the laws of King Edgar.[38]
 Anglo-Saxon historian Frank Stenton points out that the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle has relatively little to say about Cnut's reign except to note his
frequent travels abroad, indicating that he was in strong control of England. Thorkell likely acted as his
regent during his absences,[39] until they had a falling out and he was outlawed in 1021. The terms of their
reconciliation in Denmark in 1023, with an exchange of sons for fosterage and Thorkell becoming Cnut's
regent in Denmark, suggests that Thorkell had won them with an armed force.[40]
However, it was left to another of Cnut's earls, Siward, to protect his earldom of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbria"] Northumbria by
consolidating English power in Scotland; at his death in 1055 he, not the king, was overlord of all the
territory that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde"] Kingdom of Strathclyde had annexed early the previous century.[31]
The Danes had more reason to grumble about Cnut's absences than the English; he reigned primarily from
England, leaving regents in charge in Denmark.[41][42][43] He replaced Thorkell as his primary advisor in
England with Godwin, an Englishman whom he made Earl of Wessex,[44] while within three years of their
reconciliation he had also been replaced as regent of Denmark, by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulf_Jarl"] Ulf Jarl, Cnut's sister's husband, whom
Page 5
Cnut also made guardian of his son by Emma, Harthacnut.[45] Ulf in turn proved less than loyal, first
conspiring against him with the kings of Sweden and Norway, then making a power play by having the
nobles swear fealty to Harthacnut (thus effectively to him); Cnut returned to Denmark at Christmas 1026,
ordered his housecarls to kill Ulf, and it was done in Trinity church at Roskilde.[44] By the end of his life,
he had entirely replaced the Scandinavian inner circle who advised him with Englishmen.[46]
In Norway, Cnut stayed into the new year and then left Jarl Erik's son [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Eiriksson"] Hakon in charge as his regent (he
had served Sweyn Forkbeard in the same capacity), but he drowned the following winter.[47] As his
replacement Cnut sent Swein, the younger of his two sons by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86lfgifu_of_Northampton"] Ælfgifu and thus known as Sveinn Alfífuson
in Norway – along with his mother as guardian. They were delayed in southern Norway while Olaf's return
was rebuffed, but became even more unpopular than he had been. Ælfgifu tried to impose new taxation and
stricter controls on a people who valued their independence and especially resented that the new customs
were Danish.[47][48][49]
Cnut also prepared to hand over Denmark to one of his sons: upon taking power in Norway, he held a great
court in Nidaros and proclaimed Harthacnut, his son by Emma, king of Denmark.[50] As Stenton points
out, by appointing different sons his heirs in different countries, he demonstrated that he did not have "the
deliberate intention of founding a northern empire . . . [which] would remain united after his death."[51] It
may have been simply the custom of his people.[52] In any event, it was clear throughout Cnut's reign that
the weakness of his empire lay in the impossibility of finding loyal and competent regents to govern when
he could not be present.[53] And his sons could not hold it together.
After Cnut's death
The North Sea Empire collapsed immediately once Cnut died in 1035. As a matter of fact, in Norway, it
was already collapsing: by the winter of 1033, Swein and Ælfgifu were so unpopular that they were forced
to leave Trondheim. In 1034 the leader of the army that had rebuffed and killed King Olaf at Stiklestad
went together with one of the king's loyal followers to bring his young son [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_I_of_Norway"] Magnus back from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardariki"] Gardariki to
rule,[54] and in autumn 1035, a few weeks before Cnut's death, Swein and his mother had to flee the
country altogether and go to Denmark.[51] Swein died shortly afterwards.
In Denmark, Harthacnut was already ruling as king, but he was unable to leave for three years because of
the threat that Magnus of Norway would invade to exact revenge. In the meantime the English nobles,
divided between him and Cnut's younger son by Ælfgifu, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Harefoot"] Harold Harefoot, decided to compromise by
having Harold rule as regent, and by the end of 1037 Ælfgifu had persuaded the most important to swear
allegiance to Harold, he was firmly ensconced as Harold I, and Harthacnut's own mother, Queen Emma,
had been forced to take refuge in Flanders.[55]
Harthacnut prepared an invasion fleet to wrest England from his half-brother, but the latter died in 1040
before it could be used. Harthacnut then became king of England, reuniting it with Denmark, but made a
generally bad impression as king. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle"] Anglo-Saxon Chronicle said of him that he never did anything royal
during his entire reign.[56][57][58] He died suddenly in June 1042 "as he stood at his drink" at the wedding
feast of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tovi_the_Proud"] Tovi the Proud, one of the Danish thegns of his father's court. At first glance Harthacnut's death
seems to have brought about the end of the North Sea Empire.[59] However [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_the_Good"] Magnus of Norway, utilising
the agreement he had made with Harthacnut in 1040 took control of Denmark and had plans to invade
England and reunite the kingdoms and Empire. In consolidating his power in Denmark he crushed a
Wendish invasion at the battle of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lyrskov_Heath"] Lyrskov Hede initiated shortly after he had destroyed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jomsvikings"] Jomsviking
heartlands. This may have been an effective own goal as it destroyed one of the key political and military
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweyn_II_of_Denmark"] components of Sveyn Forkbeard and Cnut the Great's rise to dominence. While Magnus had ejected Sveyn
of Sweden out of Denmark in 1046, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_of_Bremen"] Adam of Bremen briefly notes that Sveyn and an Earl Tovi removed
Magnus from Denmark in 1047. This is confirmed by the contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which
Page 6
reports that in 1047 Sveyn asked England for 50 ships to help in the battle against Magnus. "And then
Sveyn expelled Magnus from Denmark and entered the country by a huge carnage, and the Danes paid him
a large sum of money and recognized him as king. And the same year Magnus died.'[60]
