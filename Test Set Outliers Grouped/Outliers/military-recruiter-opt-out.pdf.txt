Military Recruiter Opt Out Form
Section 9528 of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 requires schools to release
directory information of secondary students to military recruiters unless the parent (or
student over age 18) â€œopts out" in writing. This directory information includes name, 
address, age, and phone number of the student. 
If you do not want this information to be released to military recruiters please complete
this form and return it to the school or district office. 
It is not necessary to complete this form if you have already made a general request that directory information not be
released on this student. 
As a parent, (or student over the age of 18) I am exercising the right to request that
schools in Auburn-Washburn Unified School District 437 do not directly release the
name, address, telephone listing and school records to the Armed Services, Military
Recruiters, and Military Schools for the following student. 
STUDENT NAME: 
NAME OF SCHOOL: 
PLEASE PRINT 
Date of Birth 
PARENT OR GUARDIAN NAME (IF STUDENT IS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE):
ADDRESS: 
PLEASE PRINT 
CITY STATE ZIP: 
SIGNATURE: 
PARENT OR GUARDIAN (OR STUDENT IF OVER 18 YEARS OF AGE) 
DATE: 
Completion of this form will prevent the direct release of the name, address, telephone listing and school
records to the Armed Services, Military Recruiters, and Military Schools. Completion of this form will not
prevent the student from being included in the yearbook, school directory, etc. To completely prevent the
release of directory information a request must be made at the beginning of the school year.
