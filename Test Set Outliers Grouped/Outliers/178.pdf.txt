ARGENTINA AND THE DEVALUATION RISK
November 2000
A. General
1. Argentina Convertibility Law N° 23,928.
The Convertibility Law passed on March 1991 determined the following:
  Established a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and the national currency (1 dollar =
10,000 Australes, latter defined as equal to 1 peso)
  The Central Bank (Argentine Federal Reserve) must permanently have international
reserves (dollars, gold, other currencies) available to back 100% of the monetary base. The
Central Bank must sell all required dollars at the fixed exchange rate.
  It is forbidden any price adjustment clause by an index.
  For all transactions agreed upon before the Law, prices could not be larger than the
contractual price, adjusted by the exchange rate variation plus 12% a year (section 9). This
section affected contracts in force.
2. Legal requirements for a devaluation
To modify the exchange rate, it would be necessary to abolish or amend the Convertibility Law.
In such regards, the Congress would have to abolish the Convertibility Law or keep the
Convertibility at a different exchange rate. 
Although in principle a devaluation should not affect contracts with prices set in dollars, even
the Convertibility Law has affected contracts that were in force.
So, there is a potential risk that the eventual amendment of the Convertibility Law could affect
contracts in force.
3. Impact on the Energy Sector 
Natural Gas
  Production: Prices at the wellhead are established in dollars.
  Transportation & Distribution: rates are established in dollars.
  Marketers: The standard is that the rates are set in dollars. Enron Natural Gas Sales
Contracts set rates in dollars.
Since the natural gas industry uses the dollar as the standard currency, it should be
protected under the event of a devaluation that respects contracts in force.
Electricity
  Generation: Prices established in the PPAs are normally in dollars. Marginal Cost
declared to CAMMESA (ISO) by Gencos are in pesos, but based on costs that are
set in dollars (natural gas, fuel oil, diesel). CAMMESA determines the spot price
based on Genco’s marginal cost declaration.
  Transmission & Distribution: Rates are established in dollars.
  Marketers: The standard is that the rates are set in dollars. Enron’s PPAs set rates in
dollars.
Since the power industry basically uses the dollar as the standard currency, it should be
protected under the event of a devaluation that respects contracts in force. In the case of
the spot price determined by CAMMESA, there could be a time lag between the
devaluation and the new marginal cost declaration. However in case of a variation of the
marginal cost larger than 10%, generators can modify their cost declaration.
B. MACROECONOMIC ISSUES:

1) The performance of the monetary fundamentals does not anticipate any devaluation
risk. 1.1) If we analyze the
performance of International Backup of the Convertibility Law
Reserve, there has not been 104.0% 
103.6%
any decrease that threatens the
continuity of the currency 103.0%
board. The total stock of
International Reserves was on 102.0%
average US$34,4 bn during 101.0%  100.8%
October´00, which represented 100.4%
an increase of +US$0.9 bn 100.0%
compared to September ´00
and +US$1 bn with respect to  99.0%
December´99-August´00
average. On the other hand, 98.0% 
12/99-08/00  Sep-00  Oct-00
devaluation risk is small
because the ratio between International Reserves and the liabilities of the Central Bank
ascended to 103.6% in October´00, which represented an increase of +280 bps and +320 bps
with respect to September´00 and to December´99-August´00; respectively.
1.2) The performance of the deposits in the bank system also does not support a devaluation.
The total stock of deposits in the bank system was in average US$86.6 bn in October´00 that
represented an increase of +US$0.4 bn (+0.5%) and +US$2.7 bn (+3.27%) with respect to
September´00 and December´99-August´00; respectively.
2) The “balance sheet” positions of the public and private sectors do not allow any
devaluation of the exchange rate. The attached table shows the financial balance sheets of the
public sector, financial system, firms
and households. The table clearly  Total  Pesos Dollars
shows that devaluation would have a  Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities
very negative financial impact on the Public Sector 100.0% 100.0% 23.9% 19.4% 76.1% 80.6%
positions of the public sector and firms Financial System 100.0% 100.0% 30.8% 38.5% 69.2% 61.5%
that presently have more than 80% of
their liabilities in US dollars. In the

Households

18.6% 72.7%

81.4%
65.4%
case of the public sector, the negative
impact of a devaluation on its financial
position would be stressed by the fact
that all its revenues are in Argentinean
pesos. 
3) The Argentinean economy is
already highly dollarized. As it can be
seen from the attached graphic, the
relative importance of the private
deposits nominated in American dollars
is growing and it is higher than the 65%
of the total amount of private deposits.
