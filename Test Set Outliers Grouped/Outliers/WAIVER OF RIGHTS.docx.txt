WAIVER OF RIGHTS
Chapter 123 of the Acts of 2000, which took effect on September 28, 2000, eliminated the age restrictions in Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32.  It enables the member to take a refund of their deductions if they are eligible for a retirement allowance with twenty years of service or 55 years of age or older with ten years of service.  If you wish to withdraw your funds in lieu of a retirement allowance, you must be advised of this legislation.
A member has the right to leave their funds on deposit in the system if they have ten or more years of creditable service, and at age 55 receive a retirement allowance.
I acknowledge that I have been informed of the options available to me and wish to take a refund of my deductions.
