Crusiers  264,332  171,227  189,606  250,000  200,000
The Police Department has 21 marked cruisers which are used for patrol functions. These cruisers are subjected to much more intensive wear
and tear as compared to regular vehicles. They contain power-intensive equipment and may operate for extended periods of time, both idling
and operating with high demands on the engines, brakes, electrical systems, and powertrains. These vehicles operate on a 24/7 basis. 
Our goal is to implement a 3 year rotation, whereby marked patrol cruisers are recycled for less critical and demanding use within the
Department after 3 years, so as to extend their lifecycles. This is cost-effective because the major components are prone to failure after 3 years
of front-line patrol use. From a financial standpoint, it makes sense to recycle these vehicles rather than to risk having to perform major repairs, 
which is expensive and which takes the vehicle out of service.

Association of Massachusetts, NoFIRES, National Fire Protection Association, National Association of Fire Investigators, International
Association of Arson Investigators, Fire Chiefs Association of Massachusetts, Society of Fire Protection Engineers, Massachusetts Fire District
14, Massachusetts Fire Mechanics Association, and the Association of Public Safety Communicator. All fire service credentialing requires
continuing education provided at accredited in-state conferences. Timing of these conferences is late Spring and early Fall. All Spring FY20
conferences have been postponed to Fall FY21 (not cancelled). No Fall FY21 conferences have been cancelled. In effect, all Spring
conferences will be doubled-up in FY21 because of the Covid-19 Pandemic (original Spring FY20 conferences + Spring FY21 conferences in
FY21).  The requirement to attend double Spring conferences in FY21 is due to the fact that the various credentialing Boards have not indicated
that they will waive any of the continuing education hours for FY20. What has been reduced out of the budget request is hotel rooms for
in-state conferences - in the past used for valuable professional development networking. This will slightly impact our demand on mileage
reimbursements for travel back and forth for multiple-day conferences. The 57120 Object account also funds mandatory course books for
registration-free required classes at the Massachusetts Fire Academy.
Mileage Reimbursements 131  268  215  500  300

Fire Station #5 at 520 Concord Street. The amount and type of use for this vehicle is similar to a police patrol car in that has around-the-clock
use and significant idle time. For this reason, it should be replaced on a 5-year replacement cycle, and is being requested in the Operating
Budget as a Small Capital Vehicle expense. The current Car 2 is a 2015 Ford Expedition. This vehicle needs to be able to respond in any
weather conditions, hold a significant amount of firefighting equipment, and contain an Incident Command Post in the rear compartment. The

(Non-Bargaining).  All applicable step increases are included. We are using the latest W Schedule effective 7/1/18 for the 2 Edgell Grove

Overtime - Time & 1/2  -  -  -  -  24,500
We anticipate roughly $24,500 in OT expense’s from the 2 laborer’s and Superintendent of Edgell Grove and $500 in expenses from the
Administrative Assistant III in support of yearly operations during FY21. In using actuals from FY19 ($27,711) and combining actuals and
projected expenses for FY20 ($17,000 transferred or requested transfer into account, with anticipation of another $6,000-$7,000) we feel that a
request of $25,000 will adequately fund this account for FY21. These services include support of ongoing maintenance, snow removal
operations, landscaping operations, burial service preparation and support, and any other unforeseen circumstance that requires additional OT
coverage. In addition, staff salaries are due to increase as a result of normal step increases through bargaining agreements (1116 & 1156) that
will further drive up the cost of overtime. While we have been able to reduce expenses through creative scheduling and supporting Cemetery
operations through our Parks Maintenance Department, we continue to anticipate the need for this service.

The Superintendent of Maintenance, who is also a Certified Arborist, walked the entire Edgell Grove tree line with a tree pruning and removal
company currently under contract with the Parks Maintenance Department to identify the current status of wooded areas. This review resulted in
the identification of roughly 40 trees of various size that need to be removed as soon as possible to ensure safety at the Cemetery. Using the
current contract in place for Parks Maintenance, the estimated cost for these removals was roughly $120,000. We are proposing tackling this

Prof & Tech - Consultants  -  -  -  17,000  17,000
This request is for various consulting services in support of Cemetery operations. The primary expected cost is associated with a full property
survey that will provide lot boundary lines in an effort to reduce encroachment issues from abutters and clearly define in the field what is Edgell
Grove Cemetery property. This will also allow the Division to properly plan long term expansion areas for additional burial lots, further ensuring
the financial stability of Edgell Grove Cemetery into the future. In addition, it will allow Division staff to properly manage and maintain the
entirety of Edgell Grove Cemetery property. Through conversations between the Superintendent of Maintenance and staff at DPW, it was
recommended we contract out this service due to the enormity of this project and time constraints of DPW professional staff. As such, the
Division received a price estimate and scope of work for this service that has totaled $36,400. Our request of $50,000 covers this needed
expense and additional, anticipated expenses related with normal Edgell Grove Cemetery operations.

In FY2018 $2008 was spent on landscaping materials to replace shrubs etc that did not survive the dry conditions following a sprinkler system
malfunction. Keeping the exterior grounds attractive to the public is essential to presenting a positive image. We are requesting $800 to cover
the cost of seasonal plantings in FY21.

This account consists of the maintenance agreement for the My Senior Center sign-in database (Xavus LLC) $990, which we plan to add the
VoiceConnect function for $150 per year. This feature will allow us to robo call participants in the event of cancellations or changes to activities, 
increasing efficient use of staff. In Fy21, we need to add $380 for annual maintenance for the fitness center equipment. The Callahan Center
has since joined the other city departments with a Xerox copier agreement, eliminating the need for a separate copier agreement. The
maintenance of the AED Machine and fire extinguishers is handled by Facilities Management.
Prof & Tech - Consultants  700  318  440  500  500

We use postage for mailings for our programs such as the AARP Tax Program, Prescription Advantage and Medicare information, the
Winterization Program, programs and services information about the Center, letters to clients and announcements of special programs. We are
requesting $900 to account for increase in postage costs. Postage for the Courier newsletter (12 issues a year x $600 monthly = $7,200) is
primarily covered by the Friends of Callahan.
Communications - Advertising  3,475  -  -  3,500  -
Communications - Brochures  -  204  -  500  780
This is an ongoing expense for designing, printing, and assembling information about specialized programs of the Center including Outreach, 
Volunteerism and Support Groups. These brochures are distributed at the City Health Fair, the hospital and other health-related agencies, as
well as distributed by the Center to individuals and family members seeking information. Additional brochures may include the property tax
program, home repair program, transportation and volunteerism information etc. The pamphlets need to be updated on a regular basis and
some need to be translated to other languages. We plan to develop a new logo and want to send more brochures with the new design.
Bus Contract  1,398  1,822  1,890  2,200  2,200
Dial A Ride (Tommy's Taxi) is funded by the Callahan Senior Center and is typically limited to Framingham destinations, except in the case of
medical necessity. The transportation request must be pre-approved by the Director or the Supervisor of Social Service/Outreach. On
occasion, a request to Leonard Morse Hospital in Natick is approved to maintain continuity of care. We have asked the Friends of Callahan to
assist us if needed to cover any additional costs. The rate ranges from approximately $6 to $40 depending on the distance. The expense is
dependent on how many people need transportation for unexpected issues that would be beyond their means. Maintaining the amount at

We have ten printers, seven of which require laser cartridges to be ordered from our vendor Page after Page. The average cost per color
cartridge is approximately $220. Our target population still relies on paper copies to a large extent over online information sources. Adding
color increases the visibility and interest. Since the new contract with Xerox covers the cost of toner replacements for the main copier/printer for
the Center, this amount should meet our needs.

We are choosing to use this account for the Volunteer Recognition Event and any other meals- related expenses on behalf of volunteers and

dedicated Volunteer Coordinator on staff.

In FY21, we are choosing to use these funds primarily for the daily subscription to the Metrowest Daily News.

Education, Training, Seminars  344  1,015  1,299  1,580  -
In FY21, we are requesting an increase of $1,855 in the Training & Conference line for airfare and hotel stays at conferences for the Director &
Assistant Director. It will aid in the Assistant Director's professional development to attend a national conference. (In Fy19 this expense was
charged to line 57140.) This expense will likely occur on alternate years. We are also using this account for trainings attended by Social Service
staff. Other staff trainings will be covered by the formula grant. It is necessary to keep the staff trained in certain areas. Particular attention is in
the health care delivery systems. Our seniors are very reliant on our counseling initiatives in this area. The state provides most training, which
keeps costs down. Staff also frequently seek out no cost trainings for required CEUs. The breakout is listed below.

We expect more outreach efforts by the Bilingual Outreach worker in the community. The current Admin. Asst. III declines the mileage
reimbursement for using her car on City business, payroll, mail etc. on a weekly basis. We are again requesting $500.

This is used to cover occasional tolls or parking fees to attend meetings or trainings or such expenses as commuter rail or Logan Express. We
are reducing this to reflect pattern when this was not used for travel to and from conference; that usage is now incorporated into the Conference
expense account 57120.
Computers - Personal Computers  -  -  -  450  450
We are requesting an increase of $765 for a PC for the Customer Service Rep position. In FY15 we spent $2,030 to replace the touch screen
data collection system, maintained by Xavus Solutions with an all in one touchscreen system. We budgeted for a replacement of one of the
units in FY19, since its life expectancy was 5 years. The cost has decreased to $1,450. We expect to cover $1,000 of this expense with state

Shift Differential is for full time 1156 Union member Park Maintenance employees who work second shift for approximately 23 weeks per fiscal
year..  The employee is allowed a 9% increase in their hourly rate per the 1156 Union contract. This is calculated by increasing a Working
Foreman's regular pay at a W11/1 by 9% and then taking the difference between the regular rate and the 9% increase rate and multiplying by
the number of weeks and hours needed.

Mary Dennison Park, Longs, Galvani, etc This account is used for specialized trades including electricians, irrigation technicians, pest control, 
plumbers, locksmiths, specialized welding, masonry, overhead garage door repairs, fence repairs, painting services, as well as an elevator
maintenance contract and repairs for the elevators at Bowditch Stadium .  Our department does many service repair type work in house but

included funding for this service, but the funding request was not fully granted. The FY21 request includes needed work at Pamela Rd that has
been deferred since FY19 in an effort to address life-safety issues at this facility. This will be a multi-year project, as outlined in the Benjamin
Forestry report. 
Also, a new service in this account for FY21 is NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System).  It is estimated that it will coast
$28.50 per catch basin for stormwater runoff removal, transportation and disposal services. 200 catch basins x $28.50 = $5,700.
Tree Removal: $58,000 
The Parks Maintenance Department manages several hundred acres of properties within the city ranging from heavily wooded passive areas to
formal athletic fields. These parcels include wooded property lines with both residential and business abutters in close proximity. The
associated tree infrastructure at each of these locations requires ongoing maintenance including pruning of healthy trees and removal of risk
trees. Examples of heavily wooded park properties include Cushing Memorial Park, Veterans Memorial Park, Danforth Park, Longs Athletic
Complex, Farm Pond, Pamela Rd, etc. When incidents do arise and the claims are being processed, insurance companies inquire about tree
maintenance protocols. Neglecting tree maintenance increases liability and creates public safety concerns for public property users and
abutters. 
We are using the surveys from Benjamin Forestry, a professional tree consulting company to assess and identify needed tree removal of old
and trees at risk on park properties. Benjamin Forestry conducted 4 studies of various Parks properties that identified tree removals and
preventative maintenance of the trees most at-risk. This was necessary to maintain safe and usable amenities. The Parks Department has
completed work identified within 3 of those studies. The FY21 budget request is for a portion of work identified within the final study, which
focuses on a large land-locked, heavily abutted property located along Pamela Road. We will continue to address the recommendation within
this final study in future fiscal years as well. This funding request provides tree removal services for both preventative and reactive
maintenance. This will have an impact on what can be completed with the 4th study during FY21. To reduce the financial impact on our
operating budget, we are moving forward with the Pamela Rd project as a phased approach to reduce yearly budget increases. 
Tree Pruning: $38,000

Sealcoating and Striping
Sealcoating (color coating) and crack filling of the tennis and basketball courts helps protect the surfaces and keeps them playable for our
residents over longer periods of time. We assess existing conditions at our facilities in the fall as we prepare our operating budgets for the next
fiscal year. Depending on existing conditions at our inventory of facilities in the spring of the budgeted fiscal year (approximately 16 months
from now) we may be required to reallocate funds to alternate locations and/or transfer in additional funds due to the expansion and contraction

of surface cracks throughout the change of seasons. Areas include 1 Arlington St. basketball court, 2 Mary Dennison basketball courts, 4
Bowditch Tennis Courts, 4 Butterworth Tennis Courts, 1 Winch Basketball court, 6 Winch Tennis Courts, 1 Long's Basketball Court, 1
Butterworth Basketball Court and 2 Bowditch Basketball Courts, and a host of half-court basketball courts located at multiple Park facilities
throughout the City. This should be part of an ongoing maintenance program with a few areas being done every year. Sealcoating lasts about 5
to 6 years depending on usage and surface reaction to New England weather. After each winter we reassess the damages and areas that
need attention. At some point the court surfaces need to be reclaimed and reconstructed, similar to parking lots and roadways. These projects
are currently carried in our long-term capital plan. Currently, Arlington Street (full sized basketball court), Anna Murphy (1/2 basketball court, 2
tennis courts), and Roosevelt Park (1/2 basketball court) are all in need of repairs and sealcoating. These courts have not received sealcoating
or crack repairs within the recommended timeframe and require the proposed maintenance. The Parks Department received a written quote
from New England Sealcoating for both color sealcoating and crack repair services at these locations, totaling $44,898. The quote was received
in January of 2020 and is anticipated to increase due to continued damage and the inability to undertake this project until FY21. As a result, this
request takes into consideration appropriate contingencies that will cover potential cost increases. These contingencies total 10% and are
included in the overall Recreational Surfacing Maintenance line item request.
Maintenance - Fields  1,188  23,663  1,188  1,500  1,500
We are deferring our irrigation program once again this year and reallocating these funds to the Recreation Surface Maintenance Account to

In the maintenance division we need to repair power equipment, paint machines, pressure washer machines, ice machine, chain saws, gang
mowers, tractors, bobcats, seeder/slicers, scoreboards, parts cleaner service,etc. This account is very volatile & can easily be under budgeted
with some unexpected large bills that can occur with our heavy equipment or can easily be over budgeted if the numerous pieces of equipment
we own perform well in a given fiscal year. The Park Department Maintenance Mechanic along with the Superintendent of Park Maintenance &
Construction Supervisors determine when to send our departments heavy equipment to outside vendors for specialty repairs that we do not
perform. We spent over $12,000 in this account in FY15 due in large part to repair bills for our John Deere Tractor, Case Loader, Gang
Mowers and Bobcat. Our equipment performed well in FY16, FY17, & FY18 with only $2,083, $415, and $4,327 spent on equipment repair in
those respective fiscal years. However, in FY19 we spent $10,927, $6,686 of which was for repairs to a Kubota Tractor and $2,034 for repairs
to a gang mower. So far in FY20 we have already spent $8,071.

Portable Toilets:
We currently provide portable toilets at some of our higher use locations including, Bowditch, Cushing, Farm Pond, and Mary Dennison &
Butterworth Parks. We have many requests for other locations from user groups. At these locations, we pass the cost of the units on to the
groups requesting them. Based on public feedback concerning the cleanliness of the portable toilets, we've determined that twice a week
cleaning is required during the height of the season from May - November. United Site Services, our portable toilet vendor, has informed us
that Handicap units will increase by $15 and regular units will increase by $10 in FY21. The breakout for the portable toilets is listed below:

Throughout the year we are faced with situations that require hiring professional analysis and consultation services such as lighting consultants, 
landscape architects, environmental engineers, structural engineers, soils analysis, etc. These services are critical to assessing and
addressing short-term infrastructure needs that impact our day-to-day operations, as well as securing engineering plans and estimates
associated with proper long-term capital planning. In addition, we apply for grants that require concept plans and engineering estimates in
advance of any funds being awarded. We have successfully positioned the City to receive millions of dollars in alternative resources as a result
of effectively utilizing these services, including PARC grants, Rotary Donations, CDBG funds, Disabilities Commission funds, etc. Our capital
budgeting and planning efforts are greatly improved through the use of this line item. 
We had budgeted $60,000 in past years for these services but this line item was reduced to $23,399 (from $60,000) as part of the FY19 
budget reductions. As a result, the Division has deferred multiple projects including a study and design for the City’s first dog park, City-wide
field usage master plan, and a number of additional projects that have been presented by various stakeholders. In addition, during the last two
fiscal years, we have had the need to utilize this account to fund the Clerk of the Works for the Loring Arena project due to funding constraints
in the allocated Capital Appropriation. Our FY21 request to increase funding to $50,000 would aim to replenish this line item in an effort to
undertake deferred services and attempt to meet the growing need for additional professional analysis and consultation services in support of
the Division’s capital and operating budgets as well as long-range plans. The projects that have been deferred for these reasons are redesign
of Arlington Street Park; redesign of Danforth Park; redesign of Reardon Park; various parking lot replacement design efforts; City-wide field
usage master plan; Winch Tennis and Basketball Court replacement design and specification packet; Bowditch Tennis and Basketball
replacement design and specification packet; Maintenance & Operations Facility expansion; dog park feasibility and design; and a number of
other needed services that ensure long term planning and maintenance are not delayed.

$70,550 was spent out of this account in FY19 for Fertilizer & grass seed, which are the biggest expenditures from this account annually. 
Fertilizer and seeding is applied to all irrigated athletic facilities/complexes. Specifically, fertilizer is applied to 26 unique locations, totaling
approximately 100 acres, on a seasonal basis. In addition, there are non-athletic, highly visible, irrigated areas within facilities/complexes/other
locations (islands, landscape areas, building fronts, etc) that receive routine seasonal fertilization and seeding. The application of fertilizers to
all of these areas promotes turf health to these highly used areas. Industry standards recommends these applications occur on a routine basis
to promote turf health which ensures safe, quality turf for extended high rates of usage. Grass seed is applied to these same areas on a
seasonal basis. However, additional non-irrigated locations are seeded on an as needed basis usually during the fall growing season. The
acreage of these additional locations range from 20-50 acres depending on the need. Seeding also occurs to play area goal mouths/crease
areas (front of soccer/lacrosse/field hockey goal boxes) and middle of football fields to restore heavily worn turf areas. This seeding occurs
annually during early April for fall damage; first week in June for spring damage; and any additional areas that were worn during the summer
sports/programming season is seeded in the first and second week of September. 
In FY19, we transferred out $7,300 for the purchase of a Polaris ATV that was part of a grant from MassTrails. Our funding request for FY20
and FY21 is reflective of what is needed to support operations. 
Ballfield clay and loam are installed on skinned areas (infields) of baseball and softball diamonds. This is replaced on a yearly basis and as
needed throughout the season. Loam is an additive that is placed on grass areas of fields that help turf surfaces grow. Loam is also placed on
landscaped areas to help with plant growth and overall City beautification. 
Playground safety chips are installed seasonally and as needed under all playground equipment to act as a safety element. According to the
National Safety Council, playground areas should maintain a minimum of 12" of safety fiber (chips) to ensure safe play. With 20 playgrounds
located throughout the City on Parks Property, constant monitoring and safety chip installation is conducted. Bark mulch is installed as an
accent to landscaped areas throughout the City. The Parks Department maintains 70 unique sites that include plantings and landscape
features. Bark mulch is installed seasonally and as needed throughout the year.
Flowers & Plants are purchased annually purchase and are planted in over 70 locations Citywide including such locations as Buckminster
Square, Cushing Memorial Park, Veteran's Memorial Park, Costanza Park , local business-sponsored Island beds, Vernon Street island bed, 
Village Hall Commons, etc. Flowers and plants are replaced seasonally or as needed. These locations are also either irrigated or included on
the overall watering schedule. These landscape areas give a welcoming approach to motorist traveling throughout our community (Buckminster
Square entrance to Downtown) as well as those who visit Municipal Buildings and offices (Bowditch, Loring Arena, Callahan Center, Atheneum
Hall, Academy Building, Cushing Memorial Park, Cushing Chapel, etc).
Miscellaneous Equipment - $10,000 (Miscellaneous Equipment was moved from the small capital account to the Supplies - Materials account
by the CFO's Office in FY16)
We have a wide range of miscellaneous power equipment that is used heavily in our day-to-day operations. As required, we replace, back pack
leaf blowers, hedge trimmers, leaf vacs, chain saws, generators, and power attachments as needed. We will buy replacement engines to
extend life of small tractors, rider mowers, rollers, etc. that also get charged to this account. Item costs vary, for example weed whackers and
chain saws may run between $200 and $500 each, while a 13 horsepower leaf blower may cost up to $1,500. We are requesting $10,000 for
these types of purchases.

Quote is from Richey & Clapper
This piece of equipment would be used to transport equipment in an enclosed and secure manner. Our current enclosed trailer is falling apart
and has been fixed many times to secure the outer covering as it has become worn over time with many miles on it. The side door has become
worn and has popped open due to the shifting of the trailer frame. Leaving the equipment in a self-contained closed unit would utilize the 4 man
crew more effectively. We would surplus the current trailer in an effort to return some funds to the City general budget upon replacement.

We need a new open trailer to move equipment for operational purposes. Our older trailer has been incurring expensive repairs; the frame is
bent and are showing signs of wear and tear. The deck is rotting and needs to be replaced the axel will need to be rebuilt. The bent frame is a
major concern.
This trailer replaces an existing 1998 open deck trailer with raised metal sides and wheel wells that obstructs our ability to load and transport
larger pieces of equipment, including gang mowers. This new trailer has no raised edges or wheel wells and will allow for loading and transport
of our largest pieces of equipment, with the exception of our Case and John Deere loaders. We would surplus the current trailer in an effort to
return some funds to the City general budget upon replacement.

33 weeks per year between 10.5 and 19 hours per week. We are using the latest W Seasonal Schedule effective 7/1/18 and T Salary
Schedules effective 7/1/17 for this budget preparation. Effective use of seasonal labor reduces overall staffing expenses at the arena. The
Arena Laborers positions are required to operate the ice resurfacing equipment, collect fees from user groups skating at night, and secure the
building at the end of shifts. In the event that any of the full time staff is out, each of the Arena laborer's is qualified to cover their shift.
Overtime - Time & 1/2  4,324  3,836  5,338  4,010  4,120
Overtime is budgeted for 2 1116 members (Stan Coughlin - Arena Supervisor and Lawrence Hinton - Arena Supervisor) who are entitled to
overtime by contract. These employees will each work approximately 45 OT hours in a fiscal year. We are budgeting for 120 hours at their 5% 
shift differential time & one half rate of $30.51 ($30.51 x 1.5 = $45.77). $45.77 / hr x 90 hours = $4,120.

Shift Differential  951  835  915  973  1,001
Shift Differential is for two 1116 members (Stan Coughlin) and (Lawrence Hinton) who work second shift during operational weeks & are
allowed a 5% increase in their hourly rate per the 1116 Union contract. We have one full time Arena Supervisor (Coughlin) that is a full time
night worker with a shift from 3pm to 7pm. The second Arena Supervisor (Hinton) works days but' does work some nights during the high school
and college hockey season for game coverage. The breakout is listed below:

5% shift diff. rate = $30.51 / hr 
Difference = $1.45/ hr x 20hrs x 30 weeks x 1 (employee - Coughlin) = $870 ,  $1.45/ hr x 6hrs x 15 weeks x 1 (employee - Hinton) = $131. 
Total = $1,001
Contractual Stipends  12,543  11,950  12,883  11,559  11,695
In lieu of overtime stipend for one 1116 employee (Arena Director - Rich Weston) at $6,000 per the 1116 Union Contract.
Total = $6,000
Also, as per the new 1116 Union Contract 3 1116 employees, (Weston,Coughlin and Hinton) will get paid for holidays worked during the
Loring Arena operating season. .Those days are: Columbus Day, Veterans Day , Day before Christmas, New Years Day, Martin Luther King
Day, and Presidents Day (Hours worked on Labor Day , Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day only for Arena Director).  The calculation is as
follows:
Hinton- $29.06 per hour x 48 hours = $1,395
Coughlin- $29.06 per hour x 48 hours = $1,395
Weston -$48.42 per hour x 60 hours = $2,905

Purchases of books, audio visual, digital materials to meet the informational, recreational, educational needs of the community. The
Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners requires the Library to allocate 12% of the total budget for library materials. In most
communities, this total is derived solely from municipal appropriation. In Framingham, the requirement has been historically attained from a
combination of sources. Municipal appropriation, grant writing, restricted Trust Funds, and generous support from the Friends of the
Framingham Library, Inc. 
The support from the Friends was once a significant percentage of the equation. Revenue derived from the Friends’ video rental program once
exceeded over $130K. With changes in the way the public views movies, this revenue source has diminished significantly in recent years. A
projected revenue of 15K in FY2021 is, perhaps an overly optimistic projection. In any case, this reduced amount makes the program
unsupportable for two primary reasons: One, the staff time allocated to the collection, organizing, reporting and depositing of rental fees no
longer “equates” with the revenue. Secondly, and most importantly, charging patrons for video rental fees isn’t great public service because
there is no longer a cost saving comparison for our patrons. Find a Blockbuster Store. In other words, the end has arrived for what once was a
great service to Framingham residents. 
The initial collection of library materials housed on the Library’s new Bookmobile was purchased from the $150,000 that the Framingham Public

Currently, the Framingham Public Library offers six public spaces in which programs are held, people attend classes, and individuals and
organizations meet. No matter the event, audio visual equipment is almost always requested. While the A/V capabilities in the Library’s two
large community rooms are up-to-date, the Library’s smaller meeting rooms are without exception, either out of date, broken, or simply without
audio visual capability at all. The last A/V installation in these rooms or upgrade was over a decade ago. The proposal seeks to address this
with installation of presentation equipment that is affordable, maintainable, and easy to operate by all users.
