Finding the loopholes: a cross-sectional
qualitative study of systemic barriers to treatment
access for women drug court participants

Abstract
Background: Therapeutic diversion courts seek to address justice-involved participants’ underlying problems leading
to their legal system involvement, including substance use disorder, psychiatric illness, and intimate partner violence.
The courts have not addressed systemic hurdles, which can contribute to a cycle of substance use disorder and
recidivism, which in turn hinder health and wellness. The study purpose is to explore the systemic issues faced by
women participants in drug treatment court from multiple perspectives to understand how these issues may relate to
health and wellness in their lives.
Methods: Qualitative thematic framework analysis of five separate focus groups consisting of female drug treatment
court participants, community providers, and court staff (n = 25). Themes were mapped across the socio-ecological
framework and contextualized according to social determinants of health.
Results: Numerous systemic factors impacted women’s access to treatment. Laws and legal policies (governance)
excluded those who could potentially have benefitted from therapeutic court and did not allow consideration of
parenting issues. Macroeconomic policies limit housing options for those with convictions. Social policies limited
transportation, education, and employment options. Public policies limited healthcare and social protection and
ability to access available resources. Culture and societal values, including stigma, limited treatment options.
Conclusions: By understanding the social determinant of health for women in drug treatment court and
stakeholder’s perceptions, the legal system can implement public policy to better address the health needs of
women drug court participants.

Background
With the emergence of therapeutic courts, the legal system
was transformed as a setting in which defendants can leave
their court experiences with more than an incarceration
term and bring additional societal benefits. Decreases in
emergency room visits, criminal behavior, incarceration,
and unemployment led to over a 7:1 cost savings (Ettner
et al. 2006). Therapeutic courts seek to address the under-
lying problems leading to justice involvement, including
substance use disorders, psychiatric disorders, and intimate
partner violence. The ensuing specialty courts include drug

treatment court (DTC), mental health court, veteran court,
and human trafficking court.
DTC is designed to help a substance-abusing justice-
involved individual link with care and stop abusing drugs
(Rossman et al. 2011; Wenzel et al. 2001).  To achieve
these goals, DTCs engage with community partners that
provide services targeting the behavior the legal system
hopes to change with the use of “legal leverage.” J. Steven
Lamberti, M.D. coined the term “legal leverage” to de-
scribe a court process which can restrict freedom in order
to improve adherence to a particular treatment plan as an
alternative to long-term incarceration (Dentzer 2007).
Legal leverage can take many forms including DTC,
probation, alcohol monitoring systems and short-term
incarceration, which aim to encourage behavior change
in the individual to prevent harm to him/herself and the

community (Dentzer 2007). This effort to reach out to
meet the participant’s needs—wherever they are, is an at-
tempt to break down barriers to care (Lamberti et al. In
Press). While these efforts are important steps in diverting
DTC participants out of jail and prison and back into the
community, there has been a noticeable absence of health
partners in these efforts (Wenzel et al. 2001).
DTC has proven though variable effectiveness. DTCs
decrease recidivism by an average of 10 % for adults but
graduation rates vary widely from 10–90 % (Schaffer
2006). After DTC participation, these individuals are less
likely to use substances, engage in criminal behavior, and
to need help with education or employment (Rossman
et al. 2011). Transitional housing use and substance use
disorder treatment are increased, while cost savings are
noted. However, no consistent differences are found in
employment rate, income, family support, homelessness,
and depression symptoms. While those with justice in-
volvement and substance use disorders demonstrate in-
creased health risks (Binswanger et al. 2007) DTC studies
have not prioritized or demonstrated an impact on health,
generally using self-report of chronic medical problems as
the only measure (Binswanger et al. 2007; Morse et al.
2014). This deficiency is rooted in the disconnect between
public safety and public health wherein a criminal justice-
centered approach takes the place of a public and individual
health-centered approach to the health problem of sub-
stance use disorder (Drug Policy 2011).
Attempts to assess mechanisms of DTC improvements
have indicated varying results including: judges’ support;
case management frequency; substance use disorder treat-
ment quality; ethnic, racial, and criminogenic diversity of
population served; consistent and prompt legal leverage
including individualized rewards; and post-treatment ser-
vices. Perhaps most importantly, assessments and reas-
sessments are crucial and underutilized (84–97 %) in
order to allow for data-driven decisions on needs and
substance use disorder treatments delivered. Policy rec-
ommendations include continued DTC funding with
use, development, and more research on the impact of
evidence-based practices (Rossman et al. 2011; Taxman
2014; Schaffer 2006). Building a bridge between DTCs
and health care providers is recommended in order to
best meet participant and community needs, but is not
advanced by national DTC leaders (Wenzel et al. 2001).
DTC national standards include gender and culturally-
specific practices with improved outcomes when they are
practiced, but must be delivered by trained and supervised
individuals using evidence-based practices (Adult drug court
best practice standards 2013). Recommended treatment ad-
dresses trauma and psychiatric histories (Schaffer 2006).
However, DTC studies to date have not successfully studied
the treatment actually delivered (Schaffer 2006).  Because
less than half of evaluated programs address known 
criminogenic factors such as education, parenting, employ-
ment, and peer contacts (Schaffer 2006) it is recommended
to evaluate and address these social needs (Adult drug court
best practice standards 2013). Other recommendations in-
clude establishing a “participant profile” which includes
substance use disorder problem severity and need for sup-
plemental services. Furthermore, getting participant and
case manager feedback is advised to help measure DTC
success (Rempel 2005; Schaffer 2006). The extent to which
these legal, social, and treatment recommendations are im-
plemented is not known but are inconsistent across DTC
courts in the United States (Rempel 2005; Schaffer 2006)
and do not address systemic health barriers or impacts.
The Social Determinants of Health (SDH) Framework
can help to elucidate challenges that justice-involved indi-
viduals face. It complements the “Eco-Social Model” (Altice
2013) of the health and justice framework, expanding the
systemic context. Social determinants of health are social,
physical and economic environments or ecosystems, which
create social hierarchies and impact health outcomes, in-
cluding mortality rates. (Marmot et al. 1978, 1991). For
women DTC participants, it is important to better under-
stand legal and social policy barriers to employment, edu-
cation, housing, and transportation which may critically
impact their functioning in the community and health
outcomes. DTC stakeholder (women, community pro-
viders and court staff) perceptions on the impact that
DTC policies has on these determinants are also unclear.
The aim of this study is to explore the systemic issues
faced by women DTC participants from multiple perspec-
tives in order to understand how these issues may relate
to their health and wellness. Additionally, the study aims
to discover where public policy can address gaps in health
and improve the social conditions not conducive to suc-
cessful re-entry from DTC and incarceration.
Methods
Study design
We conducted five stakeholder focus groups in 2012:
two with women DTC participants, two with court staff,
and one with providers from two community agencies
chosen because they serve women in DTC. One of the
community agencies serves medical and social needs of
HIV patients and the other one serves survivors of intimate
partner violence (IPV) (Kitzinger 1995). Recruitment was
conducted through three primary methods: 1) Approaching
women outside a county DTC in a moderately large upstate
city in the state of New York; 2) Emailing via staff listserves;
and 3) Snowball methods of staff contacting other staff who
gave the team permission to email them. There were 82
women who participated in DTC during the recruitment
year out of a total of 320 DTC participants. Court staff were
recruited from the DTC judge, 20 case managers, two pub-
lic defenders who serve DTC participants, one district

attorney who works with the DTC population, and two
DTC court clerks. The agencies serving HIV patients
and IPV survivors each has over 50 staff members, how-
ever focus group participants were recruited from those
designated by directors to be knowledgeable about
justice-involved women. Recruitment scripts were used for
approaching women and emailing staff. Focus groups were
in private conference rooms as follows: a community health
center (DTC participants), an HIV/AIDS clinic (providers),
and in court (court staff).  Focus groups were audio-
recorded, transcribed and de-identified. Lines within tran-
scripts were labeled to differentiate between focus group
facilitators and participants. Focus groups subjects were
provided a meal and reimbursed with $10 gift cards.
Court employees were required by employers to decline
reimbursement.
Research team members developed the focus group
guide according to research goals, focus group method-
ology (Morgan and Spanish 1984), and principles of com-
munity based participatory research (Israel et al. 2010;
Sormanti et al. 2001). The guide (see Table 1 for sample
questions. Full guide available upon request) was modified
slightly according to focus group member roles (DTC par-
ticipant, providers, or court staff) and revised iteratively
over the course of the study. Questions addressed personal
and systemic barriers and facilitators to accessing health-
care. Two experienced focus group facilitators/co-investi-
gators, followed the discussion guide, attended to group
responses, and allowed a spontaneous exchange of ideas
(Brown 1999). The university Institutional Review Board
approved the protocol as low risk so in lieu of consent,

participants were provided with an information sheet. Par-
ticipants completed anonymous demographic information
sheets (see Table 2).
Data analysis
A multidisciplinary analytic team (which included per-
sonal experience as a DTC participant, an attorney, a
physician, and trained graduate and undergraduate re-
search assistants),  identified recurrent events, terms,
and social actors within each transcript. We then orga-
nized recurrences into higher order conceptual themes
(Creswell 2012). The research team conducted the ana-
lysis in several large group consensus meetings, which
included 4 undergraduate and graduate research assis-
tants. The team first coded each focus group transcript
in pairs or triads which were then brought to large
group meetings and analyzed in detail by consensus.
The team utlized ATLAS.ti software to code the data
(Smit 2002) and enter them into the ATLAS.ti system.
The lead author reviewed the codes and reached con-
sensus with the team. The team used the framework
approach (Pope et al. 2000) in which investigators by
consensus identify a model (or framework) relevant to
the data and map the data according to the model. The
team identified in this data set, themes across the
socioecological model, which included intrapersonal,
interpersonal, institutional, community, and systemic
barriers and facilitators to healthcare. In the analysis
for this manuscript, we further identified a framework
for the systemic barriers and facilitators as the World
Health Organization (WHO) Social Determinants of
Health model (Solar and Irwin 2010). Team members
then selected those themes and quotes categorized as
system-related and categorized them according to the
Social Determinants of Health model, with the rest of
the team agreeing by consensus. We sought represen-
tative quotes, including similarities and differences be-
tween participants’  views, and diverse representation
among healthcare providers, court staff, and women
in DTC.
The framework analysis method determined the cat-
egories which addressed the socioeconomic and political
context and its relationship with individual determinants
of health according to the Social Determinants of Health
model. Final coded quotes and themes were agreed to by
the research team and tabulated (Table 3). A key commu-
nity informant reviewed the data and conceptual frame-
work as respondent verification (Barbour 2001).

Governance (laws and legal policies)
Participants described how laws governing eligibility for
diversion court, convictions, and sentencing impact their
health in unexpected ways when they are not offered DTC
or lack incentive due to the nature of their charges:
“…A lot of our female clients are charged with
prostitution and…have combined chemical
dependency and mental health issues… [which have]
failed to be addressed in the past… A lot of them
don’t qualify for drug court. [They] can’t get into
mental health court because prostitution is a
misdemeanor, not a felony, so there’s no real
appropriate avenue to send them.” (Court Staff )
Participants also described laws that govern DTC pol-
icies and prevent women’s specific needs as mothers
from being taken into account:
“If your son is sick…you can’t [miss court]…I can
leave him home and he’s 13, but he has problems. I
had to leave him [when] he was sick…Thursday. I had
to go to mental health and group and he stayed home
without anyone.” (Woman in DTC) 
background check and all that they're stuck…They're
limited to where they can move.”
(Community Provider)
Social policies
Criminal history was described as a barrier to obtain-
ing employment (and health insurance) and when
superimposed on transportation, made it hard to get
healthcare:
“You might want to go to the doctors but if you don't
have insurance or you don't have transportation [it is
very difficult]. [If] you want to get a job but you have
a prior criminal history [it is very difficult] and it's
hard to get into work.” (Community Provider)
Transportation was a frequently described barrier in
all focus groups, including a lack of knowledge among
women, their providers, and court staff as to exactly
what were the available transportation resources:
“It’s hard to go to mental health if you have even a
little one with you…not having a ride, providing bus
passes, providing you know [about them]…because. I
have 150 dollars a month that I’m supposed to
support two children and myself on right now.”
(Woman in DTC)
Macroeconomic policies
Because of their convictions, the women were not eli-
gible for housing loans or numerous rentals. Lack of safe
affordable housing contributed to many problems.
“They can't get out of that neighborhood…because
when they apply for a house and they do that 
“If you live on the west side and your treatment
provider is over at Hospital 1 trying to get there… you
have to leave at 6:30 in the morning to get to a 2:00
appointment because you have to get the transfers
and you have to make sure that you get on that bus,
and you have to then be able to a walk a certain
amount.” (Court Staff )

There was concern about a cycle of incarceration, un-

“When you get out…finding employment and
whatever you may apply for you have to always list
your criminal history or convictions and that is
such a big barrier to housing and a lot of other
programs, especially when it comes to employment.
As soon as you say you have a conviction you're
automatically out the door…that a lot of times puts

people in a position [to ask]… ‘Where am I making
any progress? …I'm on parole, I have a drug
history so as soon as I go in…’  Whether or not
they have an education from college or just have
training or skills that automatically puts [them] at
a disadvantage. So [they're] gonna get denied when
it comes to housing, to a job…There needs to be
something put in place where these women are not
always rejected because that can cause them to go
back to using….It's a big problem, a very big
problem.” (Court Staff )
Public policies
Multiple groups decried delays in psychiatric treatment
as a contributor to relapse. When a long wait for psychi-
atric treatment and her psychiatric medications ended in
a relapse and subsequent incarceration, one participant
lost her job, which caused more stress:
“Now that I’m taking the medication I’m not feeling
[like] drinking or using but now I really have issues
with dealing with this job loss.” (Woman in DTC) 
“All the medications…and this is another thing with
these meds…you wanta take one for something but
then it’s gonna give you this. Wait a minute…isn’t that
what I’m taking it for?” (Woman in DTC)
Adding to the complexity of attaining sobriety, hous-
ing, and health is seeking physical safety from an abusive
partner:
“When you’re in a domestic violence situation…
she’s moving from place to place to place to place
to place to place so that this person doesn’t find her.”
(Court Staff)
Culture and societal values
There can be a variety of reasons that stigma prevents
women from getting substance use disorder treatment:
“Specifically for white, middle-class women. [there is]
embarrassment over the diagnosis. Embarrassment ‘I
got a DWI. I can’t drive anymore. I have to take a bus.
It’s all beneath me.’”(Court Staff )
Another reason for missed healthcare was financial
and lapses in health insurance:
“A lot of my clients can’t afford a doctor’s
appointment even if it’s a sliding scale because of their
low income and they don’t have the proper benefits in
place to cover that.”(Court Staff )
Combining substance use disorder treatment with
housing for themselves and their children helped partici-
pants to focus on needed health and recovery:
“When they go to residential they know they have a
warm bed, they know they’re gonna be fed three
meals a day, they know they have a place to come
home to, so it makes them more able to focus on
their health…contraceptive services…going to the
dentist….All of those things because they’re not
worrying about where am I gonna sleep tonight,
what am I gonna eat, is somebody gonna take my
kids away because we’re sleeping on a bench?”
(Court Staff )
Lack of education, health literacy, and complexity of
the healthcare system was noted as a barrier to health:
“Part of it comes down to education. Because even
those of us that each and every day work with the
system…have many of these issues. Even we aren’t
able to keep up with every single thing that’s going
on.” (Court Staff ) 
Providers were frustrated with client mistrust, suspected
racial bias, and not seeing anybenefit of urine drug testing
when it was done by community medical providers who
do not have the authority to incarcerate based upon the
results. This provider saw potential advantages:
“They try to say…because this person isn't my color
they don't understand where I'm coming from or they
don't care about me, not looking at the whole bigger
picture of what they're trying to do…with the urine
[toxicology] tests for example; they don't see that it's
about the drug interactions and [their] health. They're
seeing it's the provider who is white telling them what
to do.” (Community Provider)
Other community providers expressed understanding
of how stigma could prevent getting treatment:
“Clients have experienced…people treating them in a
[negative] way…It's to be expected…You use drugs…
You're lower income…Your children have these other
issues…Sometimes…some of that stigma and shame
do come in. [They] don't want to admit that [they’re]
dealing with this cause [they] don’t wanta be another
statistic or feed into…some of these stereotypes that
people already believe about [their] community or
group.” (Community Provider)
Discussion
In this analysis, findings revealed women face complex sys-
temic barriers to attaining health and wellness when
Page 6
Morse et al. Health and Justice (2015) 3:12  Page 6 of 9
participating in DTCs. These systemic barriers are viewed
within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health,
which includes: governance (laws and legal policies), macro-
economic policies, social policies, public policies, and culture
and societal values (Solar and Irwin 2010). Participants de-
scribed specific systemic inequities impacting the health
and wellness of women in DTC, including lack of affordable
and safe housing, education, limited employment oppor-
tunities due to criminal history, inadequate transportation,
and insufficient healthcare access upon release from incar-
ceration. While much of the effort involving DTC involves
overcoming individual-determinants of health, preventing
and eliminating these barriers at systemic levels has the
potential to increase participants’  success. DTC policies
seek to balance defendants’ accountability with addressing
underlying problems, but the courts have not taken the op-
portunities to address systemic hurdles and social determi-
nants which can contribute to a cycle of substance use
disorder and recidivism, simultaneously hindering health
and wellness (Solar and Irwin 2010; Wenzel et al. 2001,
2004). We find that inconsistent application of expert rec-
ommendations and a lack of clear focus have perpetuated
the systemic, psychiatric, and physical health barriers that
may prevent a defendant from engaging in the court
process. The obvious healthcare partners for treatment
courts include substance use disorder providers and psy-
chiatric providers. However, a much larger range of service
and community providers could be engaged to have
greater success in meeting the myriad needs of DTC par-
ticipants. Insuring wrap-around services for women in
DTC who have synergistic risks of substance abuse, vio-
lence, psychiatric disorders, inadequately treated medical
problems, and HIV/AIDS can be a first step (Meyer,
Springer, and Altice 2011).
The governance of drug court is established by state
and local governing bodies (NYCourts.gov 2014).  One
concern expressed was that DTC eligibility require-
ments limit participation of women in DTC, particularly
women arrested on prostitution charges. While the eli-
gibility requirements of DTC vary even within states, it
is critical to assess if program requirements are restrict-
ing individuals that would benefit from participation by
explicitly excluding those with dual diagnoses (sub-
stance use and psychiatric disorders) from DTC partici-
pation (Evans, Li, and Hser 2009). Increasing numbers
of human trafficking courts may help bridge these gaps.
Additionally, focus group participants address the need
for individualization of protocol and policies to encour-
age being a successful DTC participant and parent.
Some studies have indicated that having children helps
justice-involved women to stay sober; court staff could
build upon this motivator and adjust requirements
when women are caught up with their children’s needs.
(Pelissier and McCarthy 1992). 
Although discrimination based upon history of incarcer-
ation is illegal, focus group participants identified criminal
justice involvement as a barrier to education, employment,
and housing. Many employers, universities, and colleges
ask the applicant to check a box if s/he has a history of in-
carceration, despite the recent increase in ‘Ban the Box’
laws throughout the country (National Employment Law
Project 2014). Incarceration history can dramatically limit
an individual’s ability to find employment (Morris et al.
2008; Harris and Keller 2005). In terms of education, pol-
icies limiting student loans for higher education may pre-
vent attaining a degree, even if admitted despite their
criminal background (United States Department of Educa-
tion 2010). Focus group participants noted the double bind
of women who did not qualify for the support of a diversion
court because they were convicted of non-felony prostitu-
tion while conversely those with a felony conviction suffer-
ing from a subsequent lack of education, housing, and
employment.
Adequate transportation and safe housing were identi-
fied as important resources to achieving DTC goals as well
as health. Nonetheless, the US Department of Housing
and Urban Development under The Quality Housing and
Work Responsibilities Act (QHWRA) allows property
owners and management the authority for screening and
denial of federally-assisted housing program to individual
and families with specific types of criminal activities or
history (Hunt et al. 1998).  These social policy barriers
challenge an individual’s ability to participate in substance
use disorder treatment as well as access healthcare needs.
The World Health Organization suggests that the socio-
economic and political determinants of health are not ad-
equately addressed in policies and protocols (Solar and
Irwin 2010).  Individual effects based upon such policies
might include a DTC mandate that a participant secure
safe housing, but in that community, there is a severe
shortage of housing for individuals who have criminal
histories. The US Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), regulates housing for low-income
families and encourages public housing authorities to
take into consideration factors that mitigate criminogenic
risk (Federal Interagency Reentry Council). However local
authorities have the final say and may deny access unfairly.
Stigma and shame surrounding substance use disorder
were also illuminated by the focus group participants. Dif-
ferences in race, socioeconomic status, sexual identity, or
preference between DTC participants and their providers
can lead to distrust and disengagement in services. (New
York State Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence
2014).  The social stigma of substance use disorder can
negatively impact DTC participants’ ability to seek help to
improve their health (Oser, Knudsen, Staton-Tindall, and
Leukefeld 2009).  Similarly, those who are middle class,
upper class, immigrants, religious minorities, or hearing
Page 7
Morse et al. Health and Justice (2015) 3:12  Page 7 of 9
impaired can face similar barriers within their own neigh-
borhoods and institutions (Family Violence Prevention
2009; Anderson 2014).
The social determinant domains, taken in their total-
ity, present a complex web of systems that women must
navigate. When basic needs for housing, employment,
insurance, transportation, and safety are not met
(Freudenberg et al. 2005), it is difficult to improve in
the way required for DTC, health, and life success.
Despite sporadic innovative programming in some
DTCs, it is unclear how to get to the broad implemen-
tation phase of strategies which are recommended by
DTC professionals but interdisciplinary approaches
may be helpful (Adult drug court best practice standards
2013 The lack of this broad implementation may be a fac-
tor in conflicting data on DTC effectiveness in general and
on health outcomes in particular (Drug Policy 2011). This
paper adds to the literature by examining how the social
determinants of health are experienced by women in DTC
through exploring the varying perceptions of the women,
community providers, and court staff regarding the inter-
face with DTC and these systemic inequities. Community
based participatory research strategies help to inform
novel strategies (El-Bassel et al. 2012; Israel et al. 2010).
These perceptions can inform how drug court policies
might improve DTC participants’ physical and psychiatric
health while also reducing recidivism. Specifically, we 
focus on female drug court participants’ experiences in a
specialized city court. It is important to address the needs
of this particular population for many reasons. Women in-
volved in the justice system report more health problems
than other women (Staton et al. 2003). DTC participants
report significantly greater prevalence of psychiatric illness
than the general population (Goff et al. 2007; Resnick
et al. 1993).  These women are also at greater risk for
sexual and physical assault and consequent sexually trans-
mitted infections (El-Bassel et al. 2012). Given DTC par-
ticipants' co-morbid physical and psychiatric health needs,
and the unique issues female drug users face, this paper
explores how systemic issues affect access to a wide variety
of resources which play a role in one’s health.
This exploratory pilot research has limitations but
adds to the knowledge of a unique and understudied
population of women DTC participants. Our sample
had limited racial and ethnic diversity (only two His-
panic participants overall and no people of color among
court staff ),  which may have decreased discussion of
the systemic issues of racial and ethnic discrimination.
This study was conducted in a single geographical location
which may limit examples of systemic barriers. Nonethe-
less, findings were reinforced with respondent verification,
a member of the research team with experience as a DTC
participant, and a member of the team with experience as
both a district attorney and a public defender.

Conclusions
This study begins to close the gap in examining how DTC
policies and procedures might go further in promoting
women’s health. It is important for courts to understand
how their policies may directly impact these women’s daily
challenges, both positively and negatively, to navigate
health. To address this issue, political leadership is essen-
tial. An example of a potential policy change includes
funding for drug courts to begin providing training and
community linkage for higher paying jobs. Another ex-
ample would be to advocate for safe housing for those in
DTC as a change in public housing policies. This in turn
may elevate status of living and community leadership.
Currently, courts do not routinely include a feedback
mechanism to evaluate the impact of the structural de-
terminants of health and the healthcare system (Fig. 1,
Solar and Irwin 2010). The results of this analysis sug-
gest further research is needed to determine whether
therapeutic courts could increase health and overcome
systemic barriers if they are applied supportively. By un-
derstanding the social determinants of health for women
in DTC coupled with stakeholder perceptions of DTC,
the legal system and policy makers can better address
the health needs of women in DTC.
