Concussion in community Australian
football – epidemiological monitoring of
the causes and immediate impact on play

Abstract
Background: Head injuries, particularly concussion, are a major cause of concern in many sports, particularly the
football codes, driving a need to better understand injury mechanisms and potential methods of prevention. The
aim of this study was to describe the mechanisms and follow up care of concussion injuries sustained in adult male
community Australian football to identify target areas for prevention and management.
Methods: Secondary analysis of injury data collected in a cluster randomised controlled trial in community
Australian football across two states of Australia in 2007 and 2008. There were 1564 players from 18 clubs. The main
outcome measures were the number and rate of head/neck/face (HNF) injuries and concussion sustained in games. A
specific description of the mechanisms of the concussion injuries is presented along with the immediate return-to-play
status of concussion cases.
Results: 143 HNF injuries were sustained by 132 players. The game HNF injury incidence was 4.9 per 1000 game hours
(n = 138; 95 % confidence interval 4.1; 5.7). Just under a quarter (n = 34) of all HNF injuries were recorded as
concussion. All concussions occurred during games (none in training), with all but one related to body contact with
other players. Overall, 68 % of the concussions were considered within game rules, while 32 % were either outside of
the rules or unclear. Most (88 %) players left the field immediately following concussion but 47 % later returned to play
in the same game.
Conclusions: Prevention strategies for concussion need to be based on knowledge of the mechanisms of injury. Most
concussions in community Australian football occurred through body contact with other players or during tackling.
Management of players post-concussion was generally poor with over half of the cases continuing to play in the same
game. Therefore, new primary prevention strategies that target body-contact/tackling skills and improved secondary
prevention measures relating to compliance with return-to-play protocols would be valuable.

Background
The risk of head, neck and face (HNF) injuries is an on-
going issue in many sports. Of these, concussion is of
particular concern due to the potentially serious conse-
quences that can arise from damage to the brain. Several
studies have suggested that the number of concussions
reported in sport has increased in recent years (Finch

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 
et al. 2013a; Marar et al. 2012) and efforts to prevent
and manage concussion have grown accordingly. This is
particularly evident in the various forms of football
where concerns of players, parents and sporting bodies,
have driven the increased clinical and research focus on
concussion (Harrison 2014).
Each high profile case of concussion from any of the
football codes (including Association football/soccer, rugby
league, rugby union, American football and Australian
football) motivates new calls in the popular media to
mandate headgear use, particularly in community and

junior competitions. These views assume firstly, that ap-
propriate helmets are available for use in the sport to
ameliorate any impact mechanisms of injury and, secondly,
that there are no other possible preventive solutions that
could be adopted. For the common football codes played
in Australia, the current scientific evidence does not
support any protective effect for concussion from many of
the soft-shell helmets available (McIntosh et al. 2009;
McIntosh and McCrory 2001). Given the lack of effective-
ness of headgear in protecting against concussion, other
potential preventive solutions need to be considered.
Fundamental principles behind the identification and
design of appropriate injury control strategies stipulate
that strategies must be based on understanding the
mechanisms (energy exchange) behind injury causation
(Haddon 1973; McClure et al. 2004). Research into con-
cussion in the football codes to date has largely focused
on two themes: the first being helmets for prevention
and the second being concussion management. In refer-
ence to Haddon’s ten injury countermeasures, these
strategies relate to levels six (separation by a material
barrier) and nine (rapidly detect and evaluate damage,
minimise negative consequences),  respectively (Haddon
1973).  Strategies that are aimed at avoiding situations
leading to concussion occurring in the first place (i.e.
levels one through seven) have had substantially less at-
tention in recent research. There is some information
about the mechanism of head injury at the elite level of
soccer and rugby league where concussion occurs most
commonly as a result of impact and collisions or through
incidental body contact when tackling (Andersen et al.
2004; Hinton-Bayre et al. 2004). However, similar details
for community level football players and all football codes
are needed before specific preventive solutions can be rec-
ommended for that setting.
Apart from helmets, the second theme of much con-
cussion research across the various football codes has fo-
cused on post-concussion management, including
immediate treatment of injured players and protocols to
govern their return to play. International guidelines for
concussion management in sport have been in place
since 2001 (Aubry et al. 2002).  These guidelines have
been updated regularly by leading research and medical
specialists and endorsed by peak football bodies across
all codes (McCrory et al. 2013). Despite these endorse-
ments, the degree of implementation of the guidelines
and adherence to the recommendations, at all levels of
the sport, has been questioned. Of greatest concern is
the apparent lack of implementation of return-to-play
protocols (Hollis et al. 2012; Haran et al. 2015).
This study aimed to address some of the limitations
above in our understanding of concussion in the setting
of community Australian football, through a secondary
analysis of epidemiological data reported in a group 
clustered randomised controlled trial (cRCT).  Specific-
ally, data is presented on the circumstances in which
concussions occurred in community Australian football
players and the immediate within-game return-to-play
status of the concussed players.
Methods
Procedures
A secondary analysis of prospectively collected injury
data from the Preventing Australian Football Injuries
through Exercise (PAFIX) cRCT was undertaken (Finch
et al. 2009). Full details of the PAFIX study design and
data collection procedures have been published (Finch
et al. 2014b; Twomey et al. 2011; Finch et al. 2009) with
a summary of relevant aspects provided in this paper.
Information about the accuracy of the injury data collec-
tion procedures and the assigning of OSICS codes to all
provisional injury diagnoses have also been published
(Finch et al. 2014a; Twomey et al. 2011). All resources
are available online from pafixproject.wordpress.com.
A primary data collector (PDC),  who was a sports/
exercise science student and/or sports trainer, was al-
located to each team participating in the PAFIX trial
and attended a formal education session about injury
recording for this trial. Medical staff associated with
the club assisted with checking the injury data re-
corded by the PDCs. The PDCs were provided with
standardized data collection forms to record both
game/training attendance (hours of participation) and
details of any injuries sustained. These forms were
completed each week for training and games and
returned to the research team for processing.
Outcomes
An injury was defined as “something that caused a
player to seek medical attention (on or off the field) or
to leave the field of play.” Injury details recorded by the
PDC from observation and substantiated by the player
and medical staff included: the nature of injury, body re-
gion injured, likely injury mechanism, a text narrative
description of the injury-causing event and whether or
not the player immediately left the field/training area for
treatment/assessment and if they returned to the same
day. Concussion was diagnosed by medical staff in
charge of the team based on concussion symptoms expe-
rienced by the player at the time of injury. The PDCs re-
cording the injuries also attended every training session
so most diagnoses were followed up with players and
confirmed at subsequent training sessions. Based on this
reported detail, injuries were subsequently coded accord-
ing to the Orchard Sports Injury Classification Scheme
version 10 (OSICS-10) (Finch et al. 2014a).
Information about the mechanism of injury was ex-
tracted from both the pre-coded injury mechanism data

field on the injury surveillance form (which categorised
the injury as occurring as part of a tackle, a collision, be-
ing struck/hit, or other) as well as from the narrative
text description of the injury event. Details on whether
the injury event was considered within the game rules or
not was based on both whether the official signaled a
foul and from the players narrative recorded on the in-
jury form which captured off-the-ball (behind main play)
events. Information about the same day actions in rela-
tion to leaving the field for treatment/assessment and
then returning-to-play was also taken from the injury
reporting form.
Subjects
Overall, 1564 male community (amateur) Australian foot-
ball players, aged ≥18 years, were followed up over one
playing season in either 2007 or 2008. Players came from
18 clubs across two states, in regional and metropolitan
areas. A season consisted of 26 weeks (pre-season and regu-
lar season) and clubs typically held 2 training sessions per
week, with one competitive match scheduled on weekends.
Analysis
For this sub-study, data were extracted on all players who
reportedly sustained a HNF injury during the study period
(i.e. if the first letter of the OSICS-10 assigned to the in-
jury was H.) Descriptive epidemiological data on the
mechanism of injury and return to the field of play are
presented along with the injury incidence rate, calculated
as the ratio of the number of head injuries sustained to
hours played (separately for games and training, as well as
combined), with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Ana-
lyses for this study were performed using Microsoft Excel
2013, IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 and OpenEpi.com.
Ethical considerations
The PAFIX study received ethical approval from the
University of Ballarat (now Federation University
Australia) and the University of Western Australia Human
Research Ethics Committees.
Results
Injury rates
Of 1032 injuries sustained by the 1564 players, 143 in-
juries (14 % of all injuries) were to the head, neck or face
(HNF).  Of these, 53 % (n = 75) were to the head/neck,
39 % (n = 56) were to the face; and 8 % were to the
mouth/teeth (n = 12). Most (97 %) of these 143 injuries
were sustained during competition games, with five in-
juries occurring during training. The HNF injury inci-
dence rate overall (training and games combined) was
2.1 per 1000 participation-hours (95 % CI: 1.8; 2.5). Fo-
cussing on games only, the HNF injury incidence rate
was 4.9 per 1000 game hours (95 % CI: 4.1; 5.7). 
Of the 75 injuries to the head/neck, fewer than half were
classified as concussion (45 %,  n = 34),  equating to an
overall frequency of concussion of 3.3 % of all injuries.
The concussion injury incidence rate overall (games and
training combined) was 0.5 per 1000 participation-hours
(95 % CI: 0.4; 0.7) and in games only, it was 1.2 per 1000
game hours (95 % CI: 0.8; 1.7). All cases (100 %) of con-
cussion occurred during games (none in training.)
Mechanisms of concussion
Detailed information on the circumstances associated
with the 34 cases of concussion is presented in Table 1.
The majority (68 %) of concussions were reported by the
PDCs as having occurred within the game rules. The de-
scriptive case narratives of the injury event indicated
that almost all concussion cases were sustained through
direct player-to-player contact. One case occurred when
a player landed poorly and hit his head when attempting
to jump and mark (catch) the ball.
Return to play behaviours
Investigation of the immediate actions of players follow-
ing the game-related concussion incidents showed that
most players (88 % of the concussed players) left the
field of play immediately after the incident. Four players
continued to play despite an injury report suggestive of a
concussion. Fourteen of the 30 concussed players who
left the field (47 %) later returned to exactly the same
game; all had been attended to by a sports trainer or
physiotherapist at the ground.
Discussion
This study is the first to provide detailed information
about injury mechanisms associated with concussion in
community Australian football. While there is some un-
derstanding of the specific causes of similar injuries at
the elite level in other forms of football (soccer, rugby
league) (Andersen et al. 2004; Hinton-Bayre et al. 2004)
information surrounding concussion events in commu-
nity sport is very limited. This has resulted in a general
lack of measures that are aimed directly at preventing
the occurrence of situations that lead to concussion.
Much of the recent literature around concussion has lim-
ited its focus to the adoption of management guidelines
post-concussion or to the effectiveness of headgear, rather
than primary prevention (Hollis et al. 2012; Feddermann-
Demont et al. 2014).  Although important, such ap-
proaches correspond only to the later-stage levels of
countermeasure strategies, outlined by Haddon (Haddon
1973). Implementing return-to-play protocols is essential
for protecting against adverse health outcomes of con-
cussed players, however, they do nothing about preventing
the injuries from occurring in the first place. Continued
investigation of potential primary prevention measures is

cWicket area refers to a hard surface in the middle of the ground that is used

mechanisms of injury is critical for this.
In this study, all concussions sustained occurred dur-
ing games (not in training), and, all but one, were the re-
sult of direct contact between players or during tackling.
The new insights gained on when these injuries during
games should be useful for targeting potential preventive
strategies during training sessions. For example, future
research could look into the effectiveness of training ex-
ercises for body-contact, neck strengthening measures,
safe tackling approaches, etc. Additionally, in this study,
at least 18 % of concussions, and as many as 33 % (inclu-
sive of those that were unclear), were attributed to play
that was considered to be outside of game rules. While
we have no knowledge of the specific enforcement of
rules surrounding these incidents, educating players and
coaches on why these rules exist and reviewing the en-
forcement of games rules could be valuable strategies to
reduce dangerous play that leads to injury. Our results
support further inquiry as to when, why and how con-
cussion injuries occur to elucidate these potential alter-
native preventative measures.
In comparison to other codes of football, the propor-
tion of players who sustained a concussion was relatively
Page 5
Fortington et al. Injury Epidemiology (2015) 2:20  Page 5 of 6
low in this group of community Australian football
players. Overall, HNF injuries collectively accounted for
14 % of all injuries over two seasons of community
Australian football; with less than a quarter of these be-
ing concussions, just 3 % of all injuries sustained. This
proportion is consistent with previous studies in the
adult community Australian football setting (Braham
et al. 2004a; Braham et al. 2004b; Braham and Finch
2004; Finch et al. 2005).  While concern about the ser-
iousness of concussion is certainly reasonable, popular
fears about a high rate of Australian football players sus-
taining this injury are likely to be over-estimated.
Although helmets have received the majority of atten-
tion as a method for reducing the occurrence of concus-
sion, alternative measures also need consideration. This
is demonstrated by the range of injury incident scenarios
shown in our study. A recent systematic review of po-
tential modifiable factors for preventing concussion
highlighted the range of possible areas for consideration,
including rule changes, equipment (in addition to hel-
mets, e.g. mouthguards) and neck strength (Benson
et al. 2013).  However, only a handful of studies were
identified for inclusion and there was no strong evidence
arising from these studies in favour of any particular
strategy (Benson et al. 2013).
While primary prevention measures should be pur-
sued, the potential severity of concussion outcomes
means research on the implementation of best practice
management will not be, and should not be, disregarded.
Despite the long history of guidance on how to manage
concussion in sport, many cases are still not handled ac-
cording to the recommended return-to-play protocols
(Hollis et al. 2012; Haran et al. 2015). Although a posi-
tive finding was that most players initially left the field,
ensuring compliance with return to play guidelines is
important. A substantial number of players in this study
later returned to play in the same game in which the
concussion had occurred. This is particularly concerning
in respect of their injury descriptions being indicative of
the signs and symptoms of having sustained concussion,
and indeed that being the diagnosis given to their injury.
A team sports trainer or physiotherapist reportedly
attended to all the players who later returned to the
field. The actual assessment of players or advice pro-
vided is not known and it may be that players returned
to the field on their own accord, against the instruction
of coaching, medical and first aid staff. It should be
noted that both player and sports trainer behaviour and
knowledge may have changed since data were collected
for this study in 2007-2008. However, even at that time,
the first consensus guidelines had already long stated
that if a player was showing any signs or symptoms of
concussion they should not be allowed to return to play
in the current game/training (Aubry et al. 2002). In light 
of our results and with recent evidence still finding that
knowledge of return to play guidelines is largely inad-
equate (Newton et al. 2014; White et al. 2014a) contin-
ued education on concussion protocols for both players
and support staff is warranted. This has been identified
as a major challenge (White et al. 2014b; Provvidenza
et al. 2013; Finch et al. 2013b) but certainly, one that is
necessary to address. In 2013, the Australian Football
League (the peak body for Australian football) produced
and disseminated new concussion guidelines on their
community website and these are promoted as best
practice for the game. More research will be needed to
show whether people are aware of these new guidelines
for concussion in community Australian football and if
players and clubs adhere to them.
The strength in the data collection procedures for the
PAFIX trial mean that it is unlikely that injuries were un-
reported. The epidemiological field-based data collection
procedures were found to be highly reliable (Twomey
et al. 2011) and were based on those used by the author-
ship team in other similar sports epidemiology and injury
research (Braham et al. 2004a; Finch et al. 2005). As there
was no medically-qualified person involved in the report-
ing of the injuries, it is possible that some players were
misreported as either having or not having sustained a
concussion. Nonetheless, the text narrative descriptions of
the circumstances around the incidents associated with
the injuries coded as concussion are consistent with this
injury. Concussion can be a hidden injury and players may
have tried to negate any potential diagnosis. This non-
reporting has been described in a recent study with
players not thinking the symptoms were serious enough
to report or fear of being removed from participating
(Delaney et al. 2015). Based on this, the results from our
study might underestimate the concussion incidence.
However, the data collection reliability assessment
(Twomey et al. 2011) and having the PDC’s embedded
in the team training and games, suggests that the
chance of having missed injuries is very low. Although
sport concussion management guidelines have changed
since these data were collected, return to play protocols at
the time presented a similar message on return to play as
current (Hollis et al. 2012). Importantly, the key data de-
scribing the mechanism of injuries in this study will not
have been impacted by the timing of data collection.
Conclusions
In this study of over 1500 community Australian football
players a relatively low incidence rate of concussion in-
juries is reported. The detailed injury information pro-
vides insight on the events surrounding the concussion
that will be useful for injury prevention and manage-
ment. The majority of concussion injuries resulted from
player-to-player contact, within the game rules. Due to

the potential for serious outcomes and in light of poor
adherence with return to play guidelines, additional re-
search into the most effective prevention measures to
address these injury mechanisms, as well as looking fur-
ther at methods for improving compliance with return
to play guidelines for concussion are recommended.
