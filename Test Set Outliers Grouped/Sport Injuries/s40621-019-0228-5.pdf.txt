Abstract
Background: There is an increasing concern over adolescent concussions in sports due to risks of long-term
negative effects. This study analyzed data over three school years on reported concussion incidence rates by
season, high school grade levels and gender, and reported symptoms by school nurses versus athletic trainers, from
New Jersey student-athlete concussion data available from an online school-based surveillance system.
Methods: School nurses and athletic trainers reported 300 concussions within five days from when each occurred
over three school years, 2015–2018, in team sports and physical education in New Jersey high schools. Analysis was
further conducted on symptoms and number of symptoms reported by school nurses versus school athletic
trainers for each documented student-athlete concussion. Estimated concussion incidence rates were calculated
using state agency verified school enrollment data.
Findings: Concussions most commonly occurred during fall, followed by spring, then winter. Concussion incidence rates
ranged from 6.3/1000 (4.99, 7.55) – 9.1/1000 (7.27, 10.98) students over the three school years of the study. Athletic
trainers completed 86% of the reports while nurses completed 11% (position or title of 3%, or n = 7, were not disclosed);
the values were similar when considering only fall pre-season and regular season sports (88, 10, 2%, respectively). On
average, across the three school years, athletic trainers reported about 3.5 symptoms per report while nurses reported 2.7
(values in fall seasons only were 3.7 and 3.1, respectively.)
Conclusions: Certified athletic trainers, compared to school nurses, more often completed concussion report forms and
reported more symptoms per injured student, perhaps due partly to closer contact and immediate care provided after
injury. Additionally, this study had a higher concussion incidence rate during fall sports seasons compared to winter and
spring. Future research can further improve our understanding of concussions among adolescent student-athletes to
better inform concussion identification, management and recovery protocols.

Introduction
Concussion, also called mild traumatic brain injury, is of
present concern in pediatrics and in sports medicine
among adolescents (Halstead and Walter 2010). Concus-
sions can cause acute and chronic adverse effects, as ado-
lescent brains are still developing (Patel and Reddy 2010).
Using 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey data, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) esti-
mated about 15% (2.5 million) of U.S. students had at
least one concussion the prior year from either playing a
sport or being physically active; 6% reported greater than
one concussion (DePadilla et al. 2018). Adolescents and
children, compared to adults, sustain the most sports-
related concussions (Halstead and Walter 2010).  Ap-
proximately 300,000 head injuries, 90% of which are
concussions, occur among high school (HS) athletes
every year (Patel and Reddy 2010). There has been an in-
crease in visits to the emergency department for concus-
sion in the past 10 years: between 2005 and 2009, there
were also over two million outpatient medical visits for
concussions sustained by U.S. children and adolescents
(Lumba-Brown et al. 2018).
Concussion incidence among athletes is underreported
for several reasons: signs and symptoms may not be rec-
ognized by athletes and coaches, and some athletes may
not report head injuries or concussion symptoms to
avoid exclusion from play (Patel and Reddy 2010). The
ability to rapidly identify concussions in order to initiate
care and treatment is crucial. Moreover, there is concern
over repeat concussions (Covassin et al. 2013; Taylor
et al. 2018; Bruce and Echemendia 2004). Recently, CDC
published on the diagnosis and treatment of concussion
in children (Lumba-Brown et al. 2018),  the first
evidence-based (Lumba-Brown et al. 2018; Covassin
et al. 2013; Kontos et al. 2012; Merritt and Arnett 2014;
Merritt et al. 2015; Lau et al. 2011) guidelines for treat-
ment of concussion for U.S. children. The present study
analyzed reported student-athlete concussion data from
three consecutive school years (2015–2018), as reported
by a certified athletic trainers (ATCs) and school nurses,
employed full time, at public secondary or HS through-
out New Jersey (NJ) to an online surveillance system
(Shendell et al. 2018; Shendell et al. 2019). Numbers of
post-concussion symptoms reported within a week of in-
jury were also analyzed to initially compare symptoms
reported by school nurses versus school ATCs. We esti-
mated concussion incidence rates by school year and by
season for three school years 2015–2018, to expand on
previously published descriptive epidemiology (Shendell
et al. 2018; Shendell et al. 2019).
Materials & methods
A pilot study of online concussion reporting in NJ
public HS was conducted over the 2015–2016, 2016– 
2017, and 2017–2018 school years. The study was ap-
proved by the Rutgers University Institutional Review
Board (#Pro20150001455).  Details of the community
and school-based process to develop this school-based
online surveillance form are available in previous pub-
lications (Shendell et al. 2018; Shendell et al. 2019).
Consenting, voluntarily participating schools were part
of a convenience sample throughout the state of NJ,
representing northern, central, and southern regions
of the state, for a total of 12 school districts in eight
counties. There were at least two school districts per
region in each school year of the study.
Concussion injury and incident surveillance data were
collected using an online survey form (PsychData LLC).
Forms were completed by school nurses or ATCs within
five days of a confirmed concussion, which were identified
and confirmed by staff or reported by students then verified
by staff. Information on demographics, additional injury lo-
cations (neck, etc.), cause of injury (person-to-person colli-
sion, etc.),  personal protective equipment worn (helmet,
etc.), symptoms (dizziness, etc.) and activity type were col-
lected. Activity type taking place at time of injury was spe-
cifically asked in the 2017–2018 survey, although we were
able to infer activity type for all except eleven injuries
among HS students in the 2015–2016 and 2016–2017
school years based on personal protective equipment worn
and short answer responses by ATCs and school nurses,
which provided details and nature of the injury. Details of
the other variables, specifically for the 2015–2016 and
2016–2017 school years, are available in previous publica-
tions (Shendell et al. 2018; Shendell et al. 2019). Surveil-
lance data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft,
Inc.) and SAS (v.9.4, Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were
generated using Excel. Confidence intervals were calculated
using SAS. Data were stratified by grade level, gender,
school year, and by activity type, e.g.,  football vs. cheer-
leading etc.
Additional analysis was conducted to compare num-
bers of symptoms reported by school ATCs versus
school nurses; our prior research documented these
groups most often completed forms (Patel and Reddy
2010; Shendell et al. 2019).
Incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals were cal-
culated using concussion data from the pilot study and
publically available total school enrollment data from NJ
Department of Education (New Jersey Department of
Education n.d.).  Data on total school enrollment was
used as the denominator to calculate incidence rates and
confidence intervals for each school year.

Seven HS with ten campuses participated in 2015–
2016, seven HS with seven campuses participated in
2016–2017, and 13 HS with 13 campuses participated

in 2017–2018. Overall, 300 concussions were reported
over the three years of the pilot study, with 298 concus-
sions among HS students and two concussions among
male 8th graders. Concussions sustained by eighth
graders were excluded from the incidence analysis but
included in the symptom reporting analysis among
ATCs and school nurses. There were 113 concussions
among HS students and two among 8th graders in
2015–2016, 93 concussions in 2016–2017, and 92 con-
cussions in 2017–2018; these are stratified by school
year and grade in Table 1.
The average age of HS students at the time of concus-
sion was approximately 15–16 years (15.6 for male stu-
dents and 15.5 for female students).  HS students were
predominantly white (74%) and non-Hispanic (82%); 176
(59%) were male and 122 (41%) were female (Table 2).
Among HS students, the sport or activity in question
was reported or able to be determined for 287 of 298 con-
cussions (Fig. 1). There were 99 concussions (35%) which
occurred during football play or practice; 29 concussions
(10%) were sustained during girls’  soccer; and 29 (10%)
were sustained during cheerleading (although co-ed, con-
cussions were only reported among girls). Additionally, 23
concussions (8%) occurred during boys’  soccer, and 19
(7%) occurred during boys’ lacrosse. The remaining con-
cussions occurred during other sports, physical education,
other activities, or when activity type was not reported. At
least one concussion was reported for football, cheer-
leading, field hockey, boys’ soccer, girls’ soccer, volleyball,
wrestling, boys’  basketball, girls’  basketball, baseball/soft-
ball, boys’ lacrosse, girls’ lacrosse, track and field, physical
education including Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps
(JROTC) Basic Training, golf, and other activities (Shen-
dell et al. 2018; Shendell et al. 2019).
Overall, among HS male student-athletes, football con-
tributed to 93 (55%) of the 170 concussions, for which
activity type data were available. Additionally, boys’ soc-
cer contributed to 23 concussions (14%) and boys’  la-
crosse contributed to 18 (11%). When analyzed without
football, the sport breakdown for male athletes (n = 77)
included 23 concussions from soccer (30%), 18 from la-
crosse (23%),  and 11 from wrestling (14%).  Among fe-
male student athletes, 29 concussions (25%) occurred
during cheerleading, 29 (25%) occurred during girls’ soc-
cer, and 10 (9%) occurred during softball.

Over the three years of this pilot study, ATCs and
nurses completed 300 concussion reports; 86% of reports
were completed by ATCs (n = 259), school nurses com-
pleted 11% (n = 34), and 2% did not complete reporting
form job title and symptom fields (n = 7).  In total, 961
symptoms were reported among the 300 reported con-
cussions, for an average of 3.1 symptoms reported per
concussion. The ATCs reported, on average, more
symptoms associated with reported student-athlete con-
cussions than the school nurses, 3.5 versus 2.7, respect-
ively; the values for the combined summer pre-season
and fall regular season were slightly higher at 3.7 for
ATC and 3.1 for school nurses, respectively (Table 3).
Nevertheless, both groups (ATCs and school nurses)
had similar distributions of numbers of symptoms re-
ported, with a range 1–7 symptoms reported for about
88% of report forms and about 22% of report forms not-
ing either two symptoms or three symptoms per
student-athlete, respectively. Dizziness, headaches, and
sensitivity to indoor and/or outdoor lighting (artificial or
via sunlight) were consistently documented on 20% or
more of reported concussions. Although feeling disor-
iented, blurry vision, and balance issues were reported
frequently among ATCs, (range 20–27% of reported

concussions), school nurses did not report these symp-
toms as frequently (6–15% range);  it should be noted,
however, among school nurses, sensitivity to noise and
sensitivity to indoor artificial lighting ranked co-third
(21% each of reported concussions).  Both groups re-
ported fatigue and nausea in a similar proportion (12–
15%). (See Additional file 1: Table S1).
Concussion incidence rates ranged from 6.3/1000 to 9.1/
1000 enrolled HS students over the three study school years
(Table 4, presented with 95% confidence intervals). Concus-
sions most commonly occurred during fall, followed by
spring, then winter. Given the 95% confidence intervals
overlapped, overall rates varied slightly but were not statisti-
cally significantly different across the three study years.

Discussion
In 2016, CDC proposed a national concussion surveil-
lance system (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) n.d.). This study is one of multiple attempts
to address gaps in youth concussion and symptom sur-
veillance in the U.S. (Kerr et al. 2017; O'Connor et al.
2017) Also in 2016, a statewide registry based at the
University of Texas – Southwestern was established to
track concussions among student-athletes in Texas; it
was the largest statewide effort to date to track concus-
sions among student-athletes (UT Southwestern Medical
Center 2018).  Both NJ (Shendell et al. 2018; Shendell
et al. 2019) and Texas (UT Southwestern Medical Cen-
ter 2018) could serve as potential models for similar sys-
tems in other states as well as for the CDC’s proposed
national system.
Overall, there were more concussions during the fall
sports seasons, likely because of the high proportion of
male student athletes participating in freshman, junior
varsity, and varsity football (Shendell et al. 2018; Shen-
dell et al. 2019).  Participating ATCs noted there were
generally more students participating in fall sports and
how, in general, there was no upper limit on the number
of students able to join the sports teams during this sea-
son. Thus, there were likely more student-athletes dur-
ing the fall sports season, and consequently more
student-athletes at risk for concussion.
The present study’s data suggested the most reported
HS student-athlete concussions occurred during the fall,
and reported in football, which was associated with 35%
of total concussions for which activity type information
was available. This information reinforces other work in

the literature which demonstrated both HS and college
football players become concussed at higher rates than
players of other sports such as softball (Gessel et al.
2007).  One of the important findings of the present
study was how the sport of cheerleading, which is in-
creasing in popularity and numbers of participants
across the U.S. due to its athletic and energetic gymnas-
tics, acrobatic, and dance-related components, ranked
“top 3” in each study school year and in each fall and
winter sports season (Cheer Safe 2019; UCA 2019; Var-
sity 2019).  The present study thus informs ATCs and
coaches in the state of NJ and across the U.S. about
cheerleading concussions, and reinforces the message to
be particularly vigilant during the fall sports season. In
2011, the State of NJ mandated public school districts,
charter schools, and private schools adopt an interscho-
lastic head injury training program for coaches, ATCs,
school nurses, and other appropriate personnel (N.J.S.A.
18A:40–41.4 n.d.). The content of the program is at the
discretion of the individual school districts provided it
meets minimum requirements, including identifying the
signs and symptoms of concussions and a graduated
return-to-play protocol for concussed student-athletes.
Further information on specific sports where student-
athletes could be at higher risk of concussion, based on
the present study, may enhance these training programs.
There were more reported concussions among 9th and
10th graders, i.e.,  underclassmen, as compared to 11th
and 12th graders, i.e., upperclassmen. This finding may
be due to how, in general, freshman and junior varsity
teams often allow more and younger students to partici-
pate, and usually do not cut players, unlike typical var-
sity teams.
In New Jersey, a survey reported about 95% of public
secondary schools had certified athletic training services,
of which 91% served the school full time (Pryor et al. 
2015).  For comparison, 70% of U.S. public secondary
schools had athletic training services, although only 37%
of them served the schools full-time (Pryor et al. 2015;
Adams et al. 2019), and among public and private U.S.
secondary schools combined about 58% had athletic
training services, with 28% full-time (in NJ, 68 and 36%,
respectively) (Pike et al. 2017; Pike et al. 2016).  The
present study, which had a greater involvement by certi-
fied ATCs than school nurses, documented a small dif-
ference in reporting symptoms by school nurses versus
school ATCs. On average ATCs reported more concus-
sions compared to school nurses. Additionally, while diz-
ziness and headaches, the top two reported symptoms,
were the same, there was variation in the other symp-
toms reported, which may be attributable to many fac-
tors, including the symptoms which the nurse or athletic
trainer were able to see at time of injury or time of
reporting. It must be noted this study did not follow-up
with these students over time.
Concussion incidence rates by gender were not calcu-
lated in this study due to the lack of gender-specific
denominator data; however, current literature has sug-
gested female student-athletes tended to have higher
concussion rates than male student-athletes when play-
ing similar sports (Halstead and Walter 2010; Kerr
et al. 2017; O'Connor et al. 2017),  although male
student-athletes sustained more concussions overall
(Halstead and Walter 2010; Resch et al. 2017). There-
fore, analysis of concussion rates by gender, are worthy
of further study, with more symptoms assessed.
This study had limitations. First, it was a pilot project
with a limited sample size, i.e., a sample of participating,
consenting school districts and HS. Second, only total
school enrollment data were available, not team rosters,
which allowed only for calculations of season-level and
yearly estimated incidence rates. Third, the online reporting
Page 6
Gonzalez et al. Injury Epidemiology (2020) 7:1  Page 6 of 7
form was filled out by a school nurse or athletic trainer,
meaning evaluations of reported concussions were, theoret-
ically, more consistent based on the NJ-mandated training
on sports-related concussions, plus personal professional
experience. However, data were only collected by partici-
pants at one time point for each subject. Fourth, only the
2017–2018 school year questionnaire specifically asked
what activity students were engaging in while they sus-
tained a concussion. Information on activity type from
2015 to 2016 and 2016–2017 was obtained from the free-
response sections where the respondent described what oc-
curred when the student sustained a concussion. Finally,
there was no way of determining if a concussion injury oc-
curred at a participating HS but went unreported, and
assessing any difference in concussion severity by who the
injury was reported to/by (for entry into this study’s online
surveillance tool) was beyond the scope of this study..
It should be noted the first two years (2015–2017
school years) contained several free-response sections,
which led to inconsistent data. For example, activity type
at the time of the concussion injury was determined
from the free-response narrative sections describing the
concussion injury incident during the 2015–2016 and
2016–2017 school years. The reporting form for the final
year (2017–2018 school year) included more multiple
choice-style questions, which led to more consistent
reporting and may have reduced the time necessary to
complete the form.
This study had known strengths. This online surveillance
form proved to be easy-to-use, low- or no-cost, and able to
be completed rapidly (Shendell et al. 2018; Shendell et al.
2019).  The NJ Department of Education’s recent online
public release of school enrollment data allowed for the cal-
culation of estimated concussion incidence rates for the
first time using this dataset. While there is always concern
for underreporting of concussion by student-athletes them-
selves, concussion injury events in this study were identified
by staff or reported by students. It is therefore unlikely the
participating school nurse or certified athletic trainer would
have deliberately completed a surveillance form incorrectly.
When they logged into the online form, they were acknow-
ledging the specific concussion injury assessed and docu-
menting known circumstances surrounding the incident in
question.
While many states (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) n.d.) and the CDC (Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2015) have recently
made efforts to monitor and address youth concussions,
especially among student-athletes, more work remains
to be done. Reporting is inconsistent, often university-
based studies with variable sample sizes and which may
not be representative of most student-athletes, e.g., only
among male student-athletes (Long et al. 2018), or only
among soccer players (Nevins et al. 2018). 
Conclusion
This analysis suggested student-athletes sustained con-
cussion injuries throughout the school year and while
participating in various sports and activities sponsored
by public secondary schools. An online reporting form
was able to yield useful epidemiological data on concus-
sion injury occurrence. In this study, football players
comprised many of the total reported incidents, overall
and particularly in fall seasons, but student-athletes par-
ticipating in other sports such as soccer (fall seasons)
and cheerleading (fall and winter seasons) also played a
large part in these reported concussions. In future
studies, the plan is to accurately determine sizes of the
participating and most at-risk school teams to get
sports-specific estimated concussion rates during prac-
tice and competition. Guidelines for concussion manage-
ment in adults (ages 16 and older) have been available
since 2008 from the American College of Emergency
Physicians (ACEP 2008); guidelines for youth concussion
were released by CDC in 2018 (Lumba-Brown et al.
2018). Increased state-level and national surveillance of
youth concussion to complement clinical guidelines is a
public health priority.
The need for full- time and accessible school appointed
health-care professionals to the student body, which in-
cludes the student athletes, is crucial. ATCs are commonly
available after school hours when play typically takes place
as opposed to school nurses, who may only be able to see
the student during school hours.
