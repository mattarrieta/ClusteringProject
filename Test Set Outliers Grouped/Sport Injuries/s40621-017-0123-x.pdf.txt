Abstract
Managing injury risk is important for maximising athlete availability and performance. Although athletes are inherently
predisposed to musculoskeletal injuries by participating in sports, etiology models have illustrated how susceptibility is
influenced by repeat interactions between the athlete (i.e. intrinsic factors) and environmental stimuli (i.e. extrinsic
factors). Such models also reveal that the likelihood of an injury emerging across time is related to the interconnectedness
of multiple factors cumulating in a pattern of either positive (i.e. increased fitness) or negative adaptation (i.e. injury).
The process of repeatedly exposing athletes to workloads in order to promote positive adaptations whilst minimising
injury risk can be difficult to manage. Etiology models have highlighted that preventing injuries in sport, as opposed to
reducing injury risk, is likely impossible given our inability to appreciate the interactions of the factors at play. Given these
uncertainties, practitioners need to be able to design, deliver, and monitor risk management strategies that ensure a low
susceptibility to injury is maintained during pursuits to enhance performance. The current article discusses previous
etiology and injury prevention models before proposing a new operational framework.

Background
Managing injury risk is important for maximising athlete
availability and performance. Although athletes are
inherently predisposed to musculoskeletal injuries by par-
ticipating in sports, etiology models have illustrated how
susceptibility is influenced by repeat interactions between
the athlete (i.e. intrinsic factors) and environmental stimuli
(i.e. extrinsic factors) (Meeuwisse 1994; Meeuwisse et al.
2007).  Such models also reveal that the likelihood of an
injury emerging across time is related to the interconnect-
edness of multiple factors cumulating in a pattern of either
positive (i.e. increased fitness) or negative adaptation (i.e.
injury) (Bittencourt et al. n.d.; Windt and Gabbett 2016). 
The process of repeatedly exposing athletes to work-
loads in order to promote positive adaptations whilst
minimising injury risk can be difficult to manage.
Etiology models have highlighted that preventing injuries
in sport, as opposed to reducing injury risk, is likely im-
possible given our inability to appreciate the interactions
of the factors at play. Thus, practitioners must accept
some degree of uncertainty despite their best efforts to
minimise injury risk (Windt and Gabbett 2016).  Given
these uncertainties, practitioners need to be able to
design, deliver, and monitor risk management strategies
that ensure a low susceptibility to injury is maintained
during pursuits to enhance performance. The current
article discusses previous etiology and injury prevention
models before proposing a new operational framework.

history, neuromuscular control level) becoming suscep-
tible to injury via interactions with extrinsic risk factors
(e.g. game conditions, playing equipment) (Meeuwisse
1994).  It was proposed that these risk factors would
influence the athlete’s tolerance to inciting events and to
the mechanism attributable to the onset of injury.
Meeuwisse et al. later recognised that a linear ap-
proach containing a start and an end point does not
reflect the true onset of injury in sport and proposed a
recursive cycle where repeated participation occurs in
the absence of injury (Meeuwisse et al. 2007).  This
revised model more accurately reflected the frequent ex-
posures to activities associated with sporting seasons
whilst illustrating that the same factors and mechanisms
may have different outcomes (i.e. injury or continued
participation) for different athletes.
Bittencourt et al. expanded upon the dynamic nature
of injury risk in a conceptual framework to counteract
the reductionist approach of simplifying the many fac-
tors surrounding the onset of injury into separate units
(i.e. biomechanical, behavioral, physiological and psycho-
logical) (Bittencourt et al. n.d.).  It was proposed that
units of varying magnitudes of influence interact and
collectively create a “web of determinants”. In turn, this
would influence the athlete’s response to their environ-
ment leading to the emergence of an injury or positive
adaptation. The recursive elements of these models
highlight the influence of positive (e.g. increased aerobic
capacity) and negative (e.g. injury) responses on an
athlete’s ever-evolving injury risk in sports. However,
despite physiological systems underpinning many areas
of human performance, and injury healing, Bittencourt
was the first to place great emphasis on supercompensa-
tion (i.e. positive physiological changes associated with
exposures to stressful stimuli and recovery).
Simultaneously, Windt and Gabbet expanded on the
Bannister fitness-fatigue model proposed as previous eti-
ology models failed to adequately account for the work-
loads associated with training and competition (Windt
and Gabbett 2016).  Indeed, the workload—injury
aetiology model illustrated a paradox that workloads can
both decrease injury risk by increasing fitness, or in-
crease injury risk by inducing fatigue or maladaptations.
It was proposed that the careful application of appropri-
ate workload and recovery were required to manage
injury risk and optimise supercompensation.
Injury risk management models
Although these models help illustrate the elements influen-
cing the onset of injury they do not, by design, promote the
development of injury risk management strategies. In 1987
van Mechelen outlined a four-stage sequence for prevent-
ing injuries. These included establishing the extent of the
problem using epidemiology data (step 1), establishing the 
cause and mechanism of injury (step 2), introducing pre-
ventative measures (step 3), and assessing intervention effi-
cacy by repeating step 1 (step 4) (van Mechelen et al. 1992).
Finch later added additional steps to assist in the trans-
lation of research into injury prevention practise (TRIPP
model) to include a description of the intervention con-
text to inform implementation strategies (step 5) and
evaluation of the intervention via ‘real-world’, as opposed
to solely scientific analytics (step 6) (Finch 2006).
From etiology and prevention models to an
operational framework
Interventions derived from current etiology models tend
to be group-based such as standardised warm-ups or rule
changes. Although some group-based initiatives have been
shown to be effective it is possible that injury risk manage-
ment may be enhanced with personalised interventions
(Al Attar et al. 2016). For instance, diversity within a team
squad means each athlete presents with unique character-
istics which modifies their susceptibility to injury. Hence,
implementing a generic injury prevention protocol, or
clustering athletes into groups based on the presence or
absence of certain variables, may not reduce injury risk if
certain factors unique to each athlete are not addressed.
An operational framework to guide practitioners in
continuously managing injury risk whilst considering
factors unique to the athlete’s sport and profile has yet
to be proposed in a manner facilitating supercompensa-
tion. Thus, the current article builds on previous
etiology and prevention models to propose a novel para-
digm (Fig. 1).  The six stage operational framework
outlines how awareness of injury trends and risk factors
(stage 1 and 2), profiling the demands of a sport and the
capabilities of the athlete (stage 3 and 4), and monitoring
the athlete’s responses to evidence-based interventions
(stage 5 and 6) can guide practitioners in managing
injury risk. The authors propose that this novel frame-
work can build on the success of group based interven-
tions (Fig. 2).
Stage 1 – injury trends: when, where, and how do
certain athletes sustain certain injury?
Stakeholders need to understand the incidence (e.g. rate
per 1000 exposure hours, number of injuries per athlete
each season) and prevalence (proportion of population
affected) of common medical attention and time-loss
injuries across different stages of the season. Such infor-
mation can ensure that resources are targeted towards
common injuries whilst promoting compliance with
specific risk management strategies. Thus, the initial
step involves awareness of when, where, and how certain
athletes sustain specific injuries in the sport (Fig. 3).
Accounting for differences relating to the onset of injury
(e.g. seasonal cycle, inciting activity, inciting mechanism,

Fig. 1 Strategic approaches to injury risk management
probability of injury within defined time-periods) between
age-groups, playing position, and previously injured
athletes may assist in this process. Such information will
assist in identifying injury patterns and athletes at
increased risk. Understanding the impact of injury on ath-
lete availability, perceived performance, and probability of
sustaining a future injury before risk management
strategies are embedded into team programmes will en-
sure that realistic expectations exist among stakeholders.
Stage 2 – injury risk factors: what factors
heighten or migitate injury risk?
Whilst stage one focuses on synthesising information related
to the onset of common injuries in a sport, stage two identi-
fies factors influencing the likelihood that an injury will be
sustained. This involves practitioners seeking information
on factors that alter risk of incurring specific injuries, whilst
appreciating that the interactions between certain variables
can modify the impact of individual risk factors. For in-
stance, acute spikes in training load increase injury risk,
however, greater aerobic fitness decreases susceptibility
(Malone et al. 2016). Similarly, previous injury increases risk

Legend: The six stage operational framework outlines how awareness
of injury trends and risk factors (stage 1 and 2), profiling the demands
of a sport and the capabilities of the athlete (stage 3 and 4), and
monitoring the athlete’s responses to evidence-based interventions
(stage 5 and 6) can guide practitioners in managing injury risk 
of incurring a future injury, however, confounding variables
such as neural inhibition, selective muscle atrophy, alter-
ations in fascicle length, strength deficits, and increased sus-
ceptibility to fatigue need to be considered. Such
maladaptations may exist in some athletes following rehabi-
lition periods which may alter their injury susceptibiity fol-
lowing return to play. Thus, practitioners should avoid
reliance on a single risk factor when managing injury risk.
Indeed, coupling factors (e.g. physiological, musculoskel-
etal, competition schedules) related to injury suggests that
a multidisciplinary approach is required to indentify and as-
sess the relevant non-modifiable or modifiable factors at
play (Bittencourt et al. n.d.; Windt and Gabbett 2016). Suchapproaches may increase the likelihood that athletes are
provided with opportunities to complete beneficial training,
receive adequate recovery, and participate in competition
in a manner not compromising their welfare or injury risk.
Whilst this stage may not directly involve intervention, it
identifies key factors to consider in latter stages that influ-
ence an athlete’s risk of sustaining a musculoskeletal injury.
Stage 3 – sport demands: what does the athlete
need to be prepared for?
Understanding the demands of each training and competi-
tion cycle over consecutive seasons provides clarity on
which tasks athletes are to be prepared for. The measure-
ment of work rate (e.g. GPS), physiological responses (e.g.
heart rate), and subjective markers of load (e.g. sRPE) may
be useful. Such information provides insight into the
physiological characteristics required to sustain peak per-
formance including time-dependent peak work-rate (e.g.
m/s, m.min−1),  as well as loads experienced across both
acute (≤ 7 days) and more chronic (≥8 days) phases (Windt
and Gabbett 2016).  Individualised measures will allow
practitioners establish personalised graded exposures to
elicit supercompensation. Whilst appreciation of these de-
mands does not ensure accurate risk assessment stage 3
promotes an understanding of the demands placed on ath-
letes during different activities and stages of the season.
This can assist practitioners in reducing the risk of an ath-
lete being inappropriately exposed to demands they are ill-

Fig. 3 Data for understanding when, where, and how do certain athletes sustain certain injury
prepared for, thereby decreasing maladaptation (i.e. fatigue
and injury) (Windt and Gabbett 2016).
Stage 4 – athlete profile: does the athlete present
with characteristics of at risk and/or successful
athletes?
After identifying injury risk factors, a series of assess-
ments can be undertaken to investigate whether an indi-
vidual presents with the characteristics athletes more
susceptible to injuries identified in stage 1. Assessing
whether the athlete possesses the desired physical
characteristics associated with participating at a given
level of the sport may also reflect preparedness and
identify opportunities to increase performance. This
aspect is particularly important for managing return-to-
play or early career athletes transitioning to a more elite
playing standard to reduce the likelihood deficits may
impair the performance.
It should be noted that there tends to be overlap in
characteristics between athletes that do, and do not, sus-
tain injury (Bahr 2016).  However, this stage identifies
factors unique to the athlete’s profile that may need ad-
dressing to reduce injury risk and maximise their avail-
ability across consecutive seasons.
Stage 5 – athlete management: what are
favourable short and long-term interventions?
Stage 5 combines information gathered in previous
stages with the practitioners experiences and knowledge
of efficacious scientific literature, to identify suitable in-
terventions for developing components of an athlete’s
profile. With such information practitioners are best po-
sitioned to address a key question: “how do we develop
the required physical characteristics to prepare the
athlete for the demands of their sport without increasing
injury risk?”
Interventions have been identified to reduce risk of
new and recurrent injuries, as well as to develop related
factors such as neuromuscular control, force, and
aerobic capacity (Al Attar et al. 2016; Buchheit and
Laursen n.d.). When interventions have been identified,
practitioners can justify a progressive series of activities
that load the relevant physiological systems to promote 
supercompensation and increase performance of desired
tasks. Awareness of responses to training or match-play
demands, including recovery time-lines, will be essential
for planning subsequent activities.
Stage 6 – athlete monitoring: how does the
athlete respond overtime?
The aim of stage 6 is to understand how the athlete
responds to stage 5 in order to manipulate future inter-
ventions. For instance, monitoring changes in injury risk
and performance within defined time-periods associated
with an intervention can help manage upcoming cycles.
Such information can assist practitioners in coordinating
other aspects of the athletes programme to maximise
supercompensation whilst making sure efficacious inter-
ventions to reduce injury risk have been embedded into
performance-orientated programmes.
Incorporating reliable and sensitive measures in stage
6 provides important information to objectively evaluate
the effectiveness of specific interventions. Basic statistics
may assist practitioners in calculating and interpreting
dose-response relationships such as incidence, odds ra-
tio, relative risk, probability, correlations, meaningful
changes, and magnitude of effect size. Efforts should also
be undertaken to aggregate league-wide, multi-year data
to yield larger sample sizes for analysing the impact of
multiple variables on injury risk. In the meantime,
practitioners can combine monitoring of injury data
(step 1),  sporting demands (step 3),  athlete profiling
(step 4),  and intervention outcomes (step 6) to guide
future risk management strategies for the athletes in
their care.
Conclusions
The operational framework may be useful in managing
injury risk throughout the sporting season by consider-
ing each athlete’s characteristics before designing appro-
priate interventions. Examples of variables to consider at
stages 1-6 are outlined in Table 1. This article does not
intend to identify every related variable, nor does it
imply that eradication of injuries is possible if stages 1-6
are followed. Rather it proposes an operational frame-
work to guide practitioners in applying an evidence-

ation throughout the injury risk management process,
stakeholders must ask themselves “are we doing all we
can to reduce injury risk while maintaining optimal
performance for the athlete and team?”
