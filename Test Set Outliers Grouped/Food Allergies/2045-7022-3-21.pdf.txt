Abstract
Background: Our aim was to investigate the factors that affect health related quality of life (HRQL) in adult
Swedish food allergic patients objectively diagnosed with allergy to at least one of the staple foods cow’s milk,
hen’s egg or wheat. The number of foods involved, the type and severity of symptoms, as well as concomitant
allergic disorders were assessed.
Methods: The disease-specific food allergy quality of life questionnaire (FAQLQ-AF), developed within EuroPrevall,
was utilized. The questionnaire had four domains: Allergen Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions (AADR), Emotional
Impact (EI), Risk of Accidental Exposure (RAE) and Food Allergy related Health (FAH). Comparisons were made with
the outcome of the generic questionnaire EuroQol Health Questionnaire, 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). The patients were
recruited at an outpatient allergy clinic, based on a convincing history of food allergy supplemented by analysis of
specific IgE to the foods in question. Seventy-nine patients participated (28 males, 51 females, mean-age 41 years).
Results: The domain with the most negative impact on HRQL was AADR, assessing the patients’ experience of
dietary restrictions. The domain with the least negative impact on HRQL was FAH, relating to health concerns due
to the food allergy. One third of the patients had four concomitant allergic disorders, which had a negative impact
on HRQL. Furthermore, asthma in combination with food allergy had a strong impact. Anaphylaxis, and particularly
prescription of an epinephrine auto-injector, was associated with low HRQL. These effects were not seen using
EQ-5D. Analyses of the symptoms revealed that oral allergy syndrome and cardiovascular symptoms had the
greatest impact on HRQL. In contrast, no significant effect on HRQL was seen by the number of food allergies.
Conclusions: The FAQLQ-AF is a valid instrument, and more accurate among patients with allergy to staple foods
in comparison to the commonly used generic EQ-5D. It adds important information on HRQL in food allergic
adults. We found that the restrictions imposed on the patients due to the diet had the largest negative impact on
HRQL. Both severity of the food allergy and the presence of concomitant allergic disorders had a profound impact
on HRQL.

Background
Food allergies affect a substantial proportion of the popula-
tion. The prevalence of objectively documented IgE-
mediated food allergy in adults has been estimated to 1-2%
[1-3], whereas the prevalence of self-reported food allergy
is much higher (3-35%) [4].  Allergic disorders such as
asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and ec-
zema have a considerable impact on the health-related
quality of life (HRQL) of the patients [5-7]. Although living
with food allergy has been recognized as troublesome [8]
the precise impact of food allergy on HRQL has not been
sufficiently elucidated [5].
Previous studies exploring the impact of adverse reac-
tions to food on HRQL in adults have, to our knowledge,
used generic rather than disease-specific questionnaires.
Disease-specific HRQL questionnaires could be a better
tool to elucidate specific factors that could influence
HRQL in food allergic patients. A disease-specific HRQL
questionnaire focused on food allergy, the Food Allergy
Quality of Life Questionnaire (FAQLQ),  has recently
been developed as part of the EU project EuroPrevall
(The Prevalence, Cost and Basis of Food Allergy across
Europe) and has been validated for children, adolescents
and adults [9-12] as well as for eight different languages
(Goossens et al., personal communication). The FAQLQ
has been used in European countries and the USA [13].
The aim of the present study was to investigate HRQL
in a Swedish adult cohort with well-diagnosed food allergy
to the staple foods cow’s milk, hen’s egg or wheat, by using
the disease-specific FAQLQ, and to compare these results
with the outcome of the generic EuroQol Health Ques-
tionnaire, 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D).  A second aim of the
study was to investigate if we could identify specific factors
with impact on HRQL in this population. 
total, 103 patients fulfilling the criteria were invited, and
received the FAQLQ and EQ-5D questionnaires by regular
post together with a formal invitation letter containing in-
formation about the study and a pre-paid return envelope.
When returning the completed questionnaires an incen-
tive of two movie tickets was offered to the respondents.
After one reminder, a total of 80% of the respondents had
returned the questionnaires. Two were excluded because
the respondents reported not to be allergic to cow’s milk,
hen’s egg or wheat any longer, and one person returned a
blank questionnaire. Finally, 79 patients (28 males and 51
females) were included in the study (Figure 1). The mean
age of the patients was 41 years (range 19–78).
Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire (FAQLQ)
The FAQLQ is available in four versions; an adult form,
a teenager form (13–17 years of age),  a child form (8–
12 years of age), and a parent form for children (0–12 years
of age). In this study, we used the adult form, FAQLQ-AF
[19]. The validation of the original FAQLQ-AF was done
in the Netherlands where it was found to be valid and reli-
able, and it was able to discriminate between patients with
different disease characteristics [20]. The FAQLQ-AF was
subsequently translated to eight other languages (includ-
ing Swedish) and all versions have recently been validated
(Goossens et al., personal communication).
The translation of the FAQLQ-AF questionnaire to
Swedish was done according to the guidelines set up by
the WHO [21]. Thus, the questionnaire was first translated
from English to Swedish by a native Swedish speaker (for-
ward translation),  then back-translated into English by a
native English speaker, and finally the back-translated ver-
sion was compared to the original English questionnaire.
The translations were done by persons with medical skills.
Methods
Study sample
The recruited patients had documented allergy to at least
one of the staple foods cow’s milk, hen’s egg or wheat.
These particular staple foods were selected since they are
difficult to avoid in a Swedish every day diet. The study
population consisted of patients with a doctor’s diagnosis
of food allergy to any of the three above mentioned staple
foods, registered at the outpatient allergy clinic at the
Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg. The pa-
tients were identified and recruited by a clinical dietician
during 2010 and 2011 based on medical records. Inclusion
criteria were a convincing history of food allergy to at least
one of the three staple foods either ascertained by a posi-
tive food challenge with objective symptoms, or by high
levels of food specific IgE antibodies with strong associ-
ation to positive double-blind food challenge results
according to today´s standard procedure [3,14-18].  In

A pilot trial was conducted in 10 patients to ascertain that
the translated FAQLQ-AF was firmly understood by
Swedish-speaking persons. From the results of the pilot
study it was concluded that the translation of the instru-
ment to Swedish worked after a few minor linguistic
adjustments.
The FAQLQ-AF assesses HRQL in four domains: Aller-
gen Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions (AADR), Emotional
Impact (EI), Risk of Accidental Exposure (RAE), and Food
Allergy related Health (FAH), containing a total of 29 items
(Table 1). 
The questionnaire scores are based on a 7-point scale,
where 1 is the best possible (highest HRQL) and 7 the
worst possible score (lowest HRQL) [10,20,22,23]. Mean
HRQL scores are analyzed in each of the four domains
and a mean total HRQL score is estimated according to
the results in the four domains.
Floor and ceiling effects
Floor and ceiling effects (percentages of patients with min-
imal and maximal scores, respectively) of the FAQLQ-AF
were investigated in order to verify the validity and

reliability of its contents. Such effects were considered to
be present if more than 15% of the patients in a sample of
at least 50 patients achieved the lowest or highest possible
scores, respectively. If floor or ceiling effects are present, it
is likely that extreme items are missing in the lower or
upper end of the scale. In such cases, as a consequence,
patients with the lowest or highest possible scores cannot
be distinguished from each other, and reliability of the
questionnaire is reduced [24].
Symptoms
Questions regarding the different symptoms that arise as a
result of the food intake were included in the FAQLQ-AF.
All reported symptoms were aggregated into groups
according to the organs that were affected. In the present
study, the definition of anaphylaxis includes the four self-
reported symptoms “difficulty breathing” and/or “inability
to stand”, collapse, loss of consciousness, representing re-
actions in the respiratory tract and/or cardiovascular sys-
tem according to definition of anaphylaxis [25-27].  The
classification of symptoms is shown in Table 2.
EuroQol Health Questionnaire, five Dimensions (EQ-5D)
The generic EQ-5D health-related quality of life question-
naire was used for comparison to the disease-specific
FAQLQ-AF. The EQ-5D was developed by the EuroQol
Group [28] and comprises of five dimensions (mobility,
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/de-
pression). Each dimension has three levels: no problems,
some problems, severe problems. The questionnaire re-
sponses were converted into a single summary index by
applying a formula that attaches values (preference-based
weights elicited from population surveys) to each of the
levels in each dimension. As there is no Swedish index tar-
iff, for this analysis we used the United Kingdom time
trade-off value set based on the UK EQ-5D index tariff
[29]. An index of 1.0 corresponds to full health (highest
HRQL) and 0 the worst possible score (lowest HRQL). 
Statistics
The statistical analysis was performed with the IBM Statis-
tical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics 20.
Parametric one-samples T-test was used to test statistical
significance with 0.95 percent confidence interval. Linear
regression was used to estimate which symptom groups
that had the largest negative impact on HRQL.
Ethics
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review
Board in Stockholm, Sweden (Dnr 2009/84-31/5),  and
the collected personal data was treated according to the
Swedish personal data act.
Consent
Written informed consent was obtained from each pa-
tient in this study when responding to the questionnaire
for the publication of this report and any accompanying
images.
Results
Characteristics of the study population
The allergy characteristics of the 79 patients (28 males
and 51 females) are shown in Table 3. Briefly, allergies to
the staple foods cow’s milk, hen’s egg or wheat were evenly
distributed. About half of the patients had a concomitant
allergy to tree nuts and/or peanuts. Allergy to shell fish
and fish was more common in males, compared to fe-
males. About half of the patients had allergy to three or
more foods and less than one fifth of the patients had al-
lergy to one or two foods only. Symptoms from the mu-
cous membranes and skin were more common and no
differences were seen between men and women, whereas
symptoms from the gastrointestinal tract were more com-
mon in females. Almost all (90%) of the patients had at
least one concomitant allergic disorder (such as asthma,
allergic rhino-sinusitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or ec-
zema), and one third were affected by four other allergic
disorders in addition to food allergy.

Floor and ceiling effects
Only few food allergic patients reported the minimal
(highest HRQL) or maximal (lowest HRQL) score in
each of the domains in the questionnaire. Thus, the ana-
lysis showed minimal floor or ceiling effects, which con-
firms the internal validity of the questionnaire (Table 4).

The scores in the four domains of the FAQLQ-AF are
shown in Figure 2. The highest score (lowest HRQL)

to 4.85 (95% CI, 4.61-5.10). No significant difference was
found in the mean HRQL scores between males and fe-
males (4.81 vs. 4.88, respectively).
HRQL and concomitant allergic disorders
The presence of concomitant allergic disorders had a
profound effect on HRQL in food allergic patients. Pa-
tients who, in addition to food allergy, were affected by
four other allergic disorders (asthma, allergic rhinitis, al-
lergic rhinoconjunctivitis, eczema and/or other allergic
skin problems) reported a lower HRQL compared to
those who were affected by three or fewer other allergic

disorders (5.21 vs. 4.68; p = 0.03).  Moreover, having
asthma together with food allergy seemed to have a fur-
ther profound effect on HRQL compared to patients
with food allergy but no asthma (5.03 vs. 4.24; p = 0.01).
This is in contrast to the results found in the generic
EQ-5D questionnaire, where no difference was seen be-
tween patients with and without asthma (mean EQ-5D
index value 0.80 vs. 0.79, respectively). Other concomi-
tant allergic diseases did not further affect HRQL nega-
tively, irrespectively of one, two or three concomitant
allergic disorders.
HRQL and severity of food allergy
The severity of food allergy had an impact on HRQL. Se-
vere food allergy was defined as having a prescription
for an epinephrine auto injector (EAI), or self-reported
previous episodes of anaphylaxis (i.e. the symptoms “dif-
ficulty breathing”,  “inability to stand”,  collapse and/or
loss of consciousness). We found that the total FAQLQ-
AF scores were higher in patients who were prescribed
an EAI (n = 40), which shows that they had lower HRQL
compared to patients who did not have an EAI (n = 39)
(5.12 vs. 4.58; p = 0.03). However, such a difference was
not found when analyzing the results of the EQ-5D
questionnaire (mean EQ-5D index values 0.85 vs. 0.75,
respectively).  The FAQLQ-AF scores among patients
who reported anaphylactic reactions (n = 43) compared
to those who did not (n = 36),  did not reach statistical
significance, although there was a tendency (5.04 vs. 4.63
p = 0.10). When using EQ-5D, no differences were found
between patients with and without self-reported ana-
phylaxis, (mean EQ-5D index values 0.81 vs. 0.79, re-
spectively).  The number of offending foods (four or
more as compared to three or fewer) did not signifi-
cantly affect the total FAQLQ-AF score (5.01 vs. 4.67;
p = 0.18).
Among the 14 individuals who were allergic to only
one staple food, 40% had self-reported symptoms of ana-
phylaxis. The anaphylaxis diagnosis was subsequently
verified from the patients’  medical records. However,
there were too few patients for further analyses of each

Figure 2 Domains of the FAQLQ-AF (mean score and confidence

on a 7-point scale, where 1 is the best possible score (highest
HRQL). The questions were divided into the four domains: Allergen
Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions (AADR), Emotional Impact (EI),
Risk of Accidental Exposure (RAE) and Food Allergy related Health
(FAH). Based on the results in the four domains, the overall HRQL
was estimated.

individual allergen. In patients allergic to multiple food
items but with no allergy to peanuts and/or tree nuts,
41% reported that they had had anaphylaxis. The corre-
sponding figure for patients with multiple food allergies
including allergy to peanuts and/or tree nuts was 62%.
The distribution of anaphylaxis and prescription of EAI
in the three different groups was as presented in Figure 3.
Sixty-five percent of the patients with report of respira-
tory symptoms and 75% of patients with report of car-
diovascular symptoms had an EAI prescription.
HRQL and symptoms of food allergy
The effects of symptoms on the HRQL scores were further
analyzed with linear regression. All symptoms were
grouped according to the affected organs (Table 3). Symp-
toms from the skin were reported in 73%, OAS in 63%,
mucous membrane in 78%,  respiratory in 62%,  gastro-
intestinal in 71% and cardiovascular symptoms in 52% of
the patients (Table 3). HRQL was the dependent variable
while the symptom groups were independent variables in
the regression model. The F-test was significant, indicating
a linear relationship between the symptom groups and the
HRQL scores and 22% of the variation in the scores could
be explained by the symptom groups (R2-value of 0.28;
(adjusted R2of 0.22). The regression coefficients were sig-
nificant for the OAS and cardiovascular symptom groups,
however not for the other symptom groups (Table 5). As
HRQL decreases with higher points on the scale, the
regression analysis demonstrates that OAS and cardiovas-
cular are the symptom groups with most negative effects
on HRQL.
Concomitant allergic disorders were common among
patients experiencing most of the symptom groups (mean
of 2.5-2.8 other disorders).  However, patients with 
respiratory symptoms had only 1.8 other allergic disorders
on average. The mean numbers of offending food items
were quite similar in the different symptom groups (4.2-
5.0 food items) (results not shown).
Discussion
In this study we showed that the food allergy-specific qual-
ity of life questionnaire FAQLQ is a valid instrument to in-
vestigate health-related quality of life (HRQL) in adult food
allergic patients in Sweden. In this cohort with well-
diagnosed food allergy to the staple foods cow’s milk, hen’s
egg and wheat, we found that the restrictions imposed on
the patients due to following a diet had the largest negative
effect on HRQL. In addition, both severity of the food al-
lergy and the presence of concomitant allergic disorders
had a profound impact on the HRQL of these patients.
Only a few studies in adults have so far been published
using a disease-specific validated questionnaire for food al-
lergy [9],  and no such studies have been carried out in
Sweden. Since staple foods are difficult to exclude from
the diet and accidental exposure is likely, we hypothesized
that adhering to a diet excluding the staple foods cow’s

milk, hen’s egg or wheat is more likely to negatively im-
pact HRQL than a diet excluding less common foods. We
therefore recruited patients with a well-diagnosed allergy
to one or more of the above mentioned staple foods in
order to study HRQL using the newly developed FAQLQ.
A subgroup of these patients had already been included in
the analysis by Goossens et al. and were found to have a
lower total HRQL score compared to patients in Iceland,
Poland, France, Spain, Italy and Greece (personal commu-
nication). In addition, we studied the factors that influence
HRQL, and we compared the efficacy of the FAQLQ with
that of the generic EQ-5D questionnaire. In contrast to
the disease-specific FAQLQ-AF, the EQ-5D revealed nei-
ther a difference between patients with and without
asthma nor between patients with and without anaphyl-
axis (assessed as a prescription of an EAI). This firmly in-
dicates a better precision of the newly developed disease-
specific instrument compared to the generic one.
The domain Allergen Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions
(AADR) had the highest score (lowest HRQL) compared to
the three other domains, indicating that this domain had
the highest impact on HRQL. Furthermore, patients with
four concomitant allergic disorders reported significantly
lower HRQL compared to patients with three or fewer con-
comitant allergic disorders. Particularly, patients who had
both food allergy and asthma reported a lower HRQL com-
pared to food allergic patients without asthma. Similarly,
those having been prescribed an EAI had lower HRQL
compared to those who had not, indicating that those with
a more severe disease had a lower HRQL. On the other
hand, we found that the number of food items that the pa-
tient does not tolerate, does not affect HRQL, as patients
who were allergic to four or more food items did not have
significantly different HRQL compared to patients who
were allergic to three or fewer food items. The regression
analysis further emphasized that cardiovascular symptoms
and symptoms from the respiratory tract caused by the
food allergy, especially OAS, had most impact on HRQL.
However, it should be noted that some of the patients could
have misinterpreted the OAS symptoms for the first signs
of airway obstruction and anaphylaxis in such cases where
they had experienced these before.
Those with allergy to only one staple food, 36 percent
(5 out of 14) reported anaphylactic symptoms (a result
that was subsequently verified by the medical records) and
50 percent (7 out of 14) had an EAI prescribed. Whether
these results indicate under-reporting of anaphylactic symp-
toms or over-prescription of auto injectors is not known, and
will be of interest to follow-up in future studies.
Our study shows that the FAQLQ-AF questionnaire is a
valid instrument for measuring HRQL in food allergic
adult patients in Sweden. Use of this instrument also iden-
tifies the most important factors that affect HRQL. Fur-
thermore, the lack of minimal floor and ceiling effects 
indicates robust internal validity. In addition, according to
the measurement minimal clinically important difference
(MCID) a minimum difference score of 0.5 in a HRQL
questionnaire with a 7-point scale has been indicated as
clinically meaningful [30,31].  Thus, the lower HRQL
found in patients who, apart from food allergy also had
four other allergic disorders, asthma or had been pre-
scribed an EAI indicate clinical relevance (MCID scores of
0.53, 0.79 and 0.54 respectively). Such statistical difference
conveying a clinical effect was also previously reported for
patients with food induced anaphylaxis [20].
Very little is known about the social and economic con-
sequences of food allergy. The current study has shed new
light on the impact that food allergy has on the quality of
life of patients. This is valuable new information that may
help health care professionals and policy makers to de-
velop tools that could lead to better care for patients with
food allergy. A better understanding of HRQL may also
contribute to a better understanding of the issues related
to food allergy within many sectors of society, for instance
food producers and suppliers, and may contribute to bet-
ter legislation. In addition to social impact, food allergy is
likely to give rise to increased costs for the patients, their
families as well as society [12,32], but this has so far been
very little studied. This highlights the need for further
analyses of the socio-economic burden of living with
food allergy.
Conclusions
The disease-specific questionnaire FAQLQ-AF is a valid in-
strument and gives important information when studying
quality of life in food allergic adults in Sweden. In particu-
lar, the restrictions imposed on the patients due to follow-
ing a diet was found to be a factor that has a negative
impact on HRQL. Moreover, we found that suffering from
four concomitant allergic disorders, having asthma together
with the food allergy, as well as being prescribed an epi-
nephrine auto-injector also had a negative effect on HRQL.
In contrast, HRQL was not affected by the number of
offending food items. The new FAQLQ instrument adds
new and more precise information on HRQL in food aller-
gic patients, and may be a more accurate instrument in this
patient group than the commonly used generic EQ-5D.
