Abstract
It is not exactly known why certain food proteins are more likely to sensitize. One of the characteristics of most
food allergens is that they are stable to the acidic and proteolytic conditions in the digestive tract. This property is
thought to be a risk factor in allergic sensitization. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the
contribution of the protein structure of 2S albumin (Ber e1), a major allergen from Brazil nut, on the sensitizing
capacity in vivo using an oral Brown Norway rat food allergy model. Disulphide bridges of 2S albumin were
reduced and alkylated resulting in loss of protein structure and an increased pepsin digestibility in vitro. Both native
2S albumin and reduced/alkylated 2S albumin were administered by daily gavage dosing (0.1 and 1 mg) to Brown
Norway rats for 42 days. Intraperitoneal administration was used as a positive control. Sera were analysed by ELISA
and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Oral exposure to native or reduced/alkylated 2S albumin resulted in specific
IgG1 and IgG2a responses whereas only native 2S albumin induced specific IgE in this model, which was confirmed
by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. This study has shown that the disruption of the protein structure of Brazil nut
2S albumin decreased the sensitizing potential in a Brown Norway rat food allergy model, whereas the
immunogenicity of 2S albumin remained preserved. This observation may open possibilities for developing
immunotherapy for Brazil nut allergy.

Introduction
Humans rather frequently suffer from allergic reactions
after consumption of dietary proteins. The prevalence of
food allergy is approximately 1-2% in adults and 6-8% in
children and most food allergies are mediated by
antigen-specific IgE and are characterized as type-I reac-
tions [1].  Cases of severe allergic reactions including
anaphylaxis were reported for Brazil nut (Bertholletia
excelsa) [2] and the storage protein 2S albumin was
identified as allergen and classified as Ber e1.  It has
gained particular interest as in the early 1990’s it was
considered to transfer the gene coding for the Brazil nut
2S albumin by transgenic techniques to soybean in order
to improve its nutritional value for animal feed which

however never reached the market due to the allergenic
nature of the Brazil nut 2S albumin [3].
An important characteristic of food allergens is that
they tend to be more stable to the proteolytic and acidic
conditions of the digestive tract, which results in an in-
creased probability of reaching the intestinal mucosa,
where absorption can occur and allergic sensitization
may be induced [4,5]. Many of the major food allergens
are comparatively resistant to digestion, and this general
characteristic has been considered a risk factor for food
allergy induction. Furthermore, in vitro digested Brazil
nut 2S albumin retains about one quarter of its IgE-
binding potency [6], and similar observations were made
for 2S albumin-like allergens from peanut [7]. This sug-
gests that even if 2S albumins are digested, their aller-
genicity in terms of IgE-binding is not completely
abolished. Taken together, resistance to digestion does

not provide sufficient information for safety aspects in
terms of risk of allergenicity.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relation
between specific structural aspects of Brazil nut 2S albu-
min and its sensitizing capacity. Therefore, we prepared
two forms of 2S albumin from Brazil nuts, a native- and
a reduced/alkylated 2S albumin (2S albumin-R) in
which the disulphide bridges are reduced. Both have the
same amino acid sequence that provides the same set of
potential antigenic linear epitopes, but with different
structural organization. Reduction of the disulphide
bridges of Brazil nut 2S albumin led to a remarkable de-
crease in stability toward digestion [8].  Both prepara-
tions are here tested in their ability to induce allergic
sensitization in a Brown Norway rat model for food
allergy.
Findings
Materials and methods
Disulphide bridges of 2S albumin were reduced and
alkylated resulting in unfolding of the protein [8], here
referred to as 2S albumin-R. To study the sensitizing
capacity of the structurally different forms of 2S albu-
min [8] in vivo we used an oral Brown Norway rat food
allergy model. Young male Brown Norway (BN) rats
(3-4 weeks old at arrival) obtained from Charles River
(Sulzfeld, Germany) were bred and raised on a com-
mercially available Brazil nut free rodent diet (SDS Special
Diet Service, LAD1 (E) SQC, Witham, England). For the
oral sensitization animals (n = 10) were exposed by gav-
age dosing during 6 weeks to either 2S albumin-R or
native 2S albumin (0.1 mg or 1 mg protein/ml tap
water; 1 ml/animal) without the use of an adjuvant or
only water (controls).  Blood samples were obtained
days 0, 28 and 42 and sera were prepared. Positive con-
trol animals (n = 5) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with 0.5 ml of a 0.2 mg/ml RA- or native 2S albumin
solution in sterile saline on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11. In
the positive control animals, the immune response was
potentiated at day 0 with 0.2 ml of a 25 mg/ml Al(OH)
3 adjuvant suspension in sterile saline mixed with the
0.5 ml of 2S albumin or 2S albumin-R solution. The an-
imals were bled on day 28. The sera were analyzed for
anti-native- and 2S albumin-R-specific IgG1 (Thelper-1
mediated),  IgG2a and IgE (Thelper-2 mediated) titers
by ELISA and by Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis (PCA)
essentially as described previously [9].  Data were ana-
lysed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-
hoc test using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The welfare of the ani-
mals was maintained in accordance with the general
principles governing the use of animals in experiments
of the European Communities (Directive 86/209/EEC)
and Dutch legislation (The experiments on Animals 
Act, 1997),  which includes approval of the study by
TNO's ethical review committee under DEC number
1732.
Results and discussion
From the animals orally exposed to native 2S albumin
the majority developed 2S albumin-specific IgG1 and
IgG2a responses at days 28 and 42 in a dose-dependent
way whereas oral exposure to 2S albumin-R resulted in a
lower number of responding animals (Figure 1A + B). At
day 28, i.p. exposure of the animals to native 2S albumin
resulted in the development of very pronounced 2S
albumin-specific IgG1 and IgG2a responses in all ani-
mals (Figure 1A). I.p. exposure to 2S albumin-R resulted
in 2S albumin-R-specific IgG1 and IgG2a responses in
80% of the animals. Both oral (0.1 and 1 mg protein/rat/
day) and i.p. exposure of the animals to 2S albumin-R
did not result in the development of 2S albumin-
R-specific IgE antibodies. In contrast, oral dosing of the
Figure 1 2S albumin and 2S albumin-R-specific IgG1 (■) and IgG2a
(□) titers were analyzed upon daily intra-gastric dosing of BN rats
(n=10/group) with water, 0.1 mg and 1 mg 2S albumin or 2S
albumin-R per rat for 28 days (A) or 42 days (B). Positive control
animals (n=5/group) received multiple i.p. sensitizations prior serum
analyses at day 28 (A). The data are presented as mean 2log Ig titer ± SD
of the number of responding rats (indicated as percentage in the bars)
per group. Statistical differences between oral dosing groups or between
i.p. dosing groups are depicted (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

animals to either 0.1 mg or 1 mg native 2S albumin
resulted in 2S albumin-specific IgE responses in 50% of
the animals and i.p. exposure lead to 100% responders.
These results were confirmed by PCA testing (Figure 2).
These results show that reduction of disulfide bonds and
concomittal loss of protein structure and an increased
sensitivity for digestion of Brazil nut 2S albumin [8], de-
creases the prominent sensitizing potential of 2S albu-
min in the oral BN rat food allergy model. Not all
animals developed specific antibody responses upon oral
exposure to 2S albumin. This phenomenon is also ob-
served with other food allergens like ovalbumin and
cow’s milk using the described BN rat food allergy model
[9]. While the allergenicity of 2S albumin-R was dramat-
ically decreased, the immunogenicity of the protein still
existed since specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies against
2S albumin were produced, although at a lower level
compared to native 2S albumin.
Evidence for an important role of the structural con-
formation (the secondary and tertiary structure) of the
protein with respect to food protein allergenicity also
comes from animal studies. Prefeeding of an endopep-
tidase inhibitor (aprotinin) to mice results in an inhib-
ition of oral tolerance induction by protein feeding [10]
while feeding of protein antigen to mice is known to in-
duce substantial systemic tolerance for specific antibody
and cell mediated immune responses under normal cir-
cumstances [11]. Recently it was shown that by regulat-
ing the gastric pH the dose-dependency of food allergy
induction was influenced [12].  The effect of anti-ulcer

specific IgE as measured by PCA tests were determined upon daily
intragastric dosing of BN rats (n = 10) with water, 0.1 mg and 1 mg
2S albumin or 2S albumin-R per rat for 42 days or after i.p.
sensitization (n = 5; day 28 sera), respectively. Data are given as the

drugs that increase the gastric pH on the formation of
IgE in humans was investigated previously [13].  It was
found that pre-existing IgE was boosted to higher levels
and that de novo IgE towards digestion-labile food pro-
teins was induced. The implications of regulating the
gastric pH on the risks for food allergic consumers were
recently reviewed [14]. While the above mentioned stud-
ies investigated the effect of decreasing the susceptibility
to proteolysis, we investigated the effect of increasing
the susceptibility to proteolysis.
Disruption of the structural conformation of protein by
alkylation/denaturation has previously been used to gener-
ate hypoallergenic variants of Ara h2 [15] and Pru p3 [16],
respectively the major peanut and peach allergen. Although
no hypoallergenic derivatives have received marketing
authorization to date, they are suggested to be promising
vaccine candidates for immunotherapy. The reduced IgE-
antibody-binding capacity reduces the frequency of adverse
reactions during allergen-specific immunotherapy, allowing
the application of higher amounts of allergen with a re-
duced risk of serious adverse effects [17,18]. Moreover, T
cell immunogenicity needs to be preserved to maintain the
therapeutic potential [19,20].  In line with this, we here
show that the reduced/alkylated Brazil nut 2S albumin
showed a reduction in biologically active IgE (by PCA),
reflecting a reduced allergenic potential, whereas the im-
munogenicity remained intact.
Interestingly, if the native 2S albumin and 2S albumin-R
form were injected i.p. together with alum as an adjuvant,
specific IgE antibodies were only observed in animals
treated with the native 2S albumin. As upon i.p. exposure
degradation by the digestive tract will be absent and more-
over the tolerogenic mucosal sites are bypassed, it is sug-
gested that other aspects may also influence the potential
allergenicity of a protein. It is known that proteases
present in dendritic cells (DC) generate peptides from for-
eign and self proteins for eventual capture and display to
T cells, demonstrating that individual proteolytic enzymes
may have a clear contribution to antigen processing [21].
In fact, it was recently shown that the immunogenicity of
Bet v1, the major birch pollen allergen, could be influ-
enced by changing the susceptibility towards digestion
[22].  Similar observations were made for 2S albumins
from other allergenic plant foods when injected i.p. [16].
Native 2S albumin compared to 2S albumine-R is rela-
tively stable to digestion [8], an altered degradation by in-
dividual proteolytic enzymes and subsequent presentation
of both peptide fragments by antigen presenting cells may
thus lead to an altered antibody response. This may
explain the observed difference in response against 2S
albumin and 2S albumin-R upon i.p. administration. In
conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the im-
portance of the protein structure of Brazil nut 2S albumin
in inducing food allergy. The observation that modified

genicity is reduced opens possibilities for developing
