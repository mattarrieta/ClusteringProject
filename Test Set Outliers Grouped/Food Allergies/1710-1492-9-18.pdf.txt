Abstract
Background: Insufficient knowledge of food allergy and anaphylaxis has been identified by caregivers as an
important barrier to coping, and a potential cause of fear and anxiety, particularly for those with children newly
diagnosed with food allergy.
The purpose of the study was to better understand the experiences of caregivers of children with a first allergic
reaction to food, and to identify any deficiencies in the information received at diagnosis.
Methods: A mixed-methods study consisting of an online survey administered to the Anaphylaxis Canada online
registry (a patient support group database of approximately 10,000 members), and a follow-up qualitative interview
with a subset of survey participants. Analysis consisted of frequency analysis (quantitative and qualitative data) and
descriptive statistics to calculate proportions and means with standard deviations. Qualitative analyses were guided
by the constant comparative method of grounded theory methodology.
Results: Of 293 survey respondents, 208 were eligible to complete the survey (first allergic reaction to food within
12 months of the study), and 184 respondents consented. Identified gaps included education about food allergy,
anaphylaxis management, for example, how to use epinephrine auto- injectors, and coping strategies for fear and
anxiety. The qualitative follow-up study supported these findings, yielding 3 major themes: 1) lack of provision of
information following the episode on the recognition and management of food allergy related allergic reactions, 2)
prolonged wait times for an allergist, and 3) significant family anxiety.
Conclusions: The online survey highlighted multiple deficiencies at diagnosis, findings which were supported by
the follow up qualitative study. Results will inform the development of educational strategies for patients newly
diagnosed with food allergy.

Background
Regardless of the healthcare setting, management of
food allergy and anaphylaxis remains suboptimal [1,2],
and the provision of education to primary care pro-
viders, patients and their families is inadequate [3-5]. A
systematic review of gaps in anaphylaxis management
showed that physicians lack knowledge on how to use
epinephrine auto-injectors [6], fail to provide training to
patients on their use [6-9], and few refer patients to an
allergist even from the Emergency Department(ED)

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 
[10,11].  From the patient and caregiver perspective,
knowledge gaps include recognition and management of
anaphylaxis [8,12-14], food avoidance [15,16], food aller-
gen control in the diet and the environment [17],  and
how to use epinephrine auto-injectors [14,18-20].  Pro-
vision of educational materials by primary care, as well
as discharge instructions from the ED on allergen avoid-
ance [11,21] and auto-injectors [7] is also lacking. These
deficiencies have been associated with fear and anxiety
[22] and are important barriers to coping for parents of
children at risk. Furthermore, the continuum of care
that leads to a confirmed diagnosis is not well under-
stood. The objectives of this study were to understand
the experiences of caregivers of children with first-time

allergic reactions to food (within 12 months of the
study) and to identify any existing deficiencies in the in-
formation they received at diagnosis.
Methods
A mixed methods study consisting of an Internet-based
questionnaire (via Survey Monkey) administered in 2010
(Phase 1); and a follow-up qualitative study conducted in
2011 using telephone interviews and open-ended ques-
tionnaires with a subset of survey participants (Phase 2).
The study was approved by the McMaster University
Hamilton Health Sciences research ethics board. The
surveys and interviews were conducted in English. Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained for all participants
and confirmed orally for those participating in the tele-
phone interviews.
Phase 1: survey
Caregivers of children (age ≤ 18 years) with a newly diag-
nosed food-related allergic reaction within 12 months of
the study were recruited using an e-mail invitation to
members of Anaphylaxis Canada. Patients and family
members become members of Anaphylaxis Canada on a
volunteer basis, although they are also referred to the
website by pharmacists, nurses, and physicians. The invi-
tation included a brief email description of the study and
the URL link to the survey, which was also available
through the Anaphylaxis Canada website ([URL: "http://www.anaphylaxis.ca/"] http://www.
 anaphylaxis.ca/). We used the predefined target popula-
tion criteria and recruitment resources listed above to
sample participants as this method was considered the
most appropriate for our study design and research
questions [23,24].  It was estimated that approximately
300–500 surveys would be returned (using a response
rate of 3-5% from a database of 10,000 people). Analyses
consisted of frequency analysis (quantitative and qualita-
tive data) and descriptive statistics to calculate proportions
and means with standard deviations (SDs). All statistical
analyses were carried out using SPSS (Macintosh version
17.0). Open-ended questions were analysed by two in-
dependent coders using grounded theory methodology
to identify themes.
Phase 2: qualitative phone interviews and questionnaires
Phase 1 respondents were invited to participate in a
follow-up telephone interview, of which 114 survey re-
spondents expressed interest. Ten participants across
Canada were randomly selected for the interviews while
the remainder were invited to complete a paper-based
version featuring identical questions. Two researchers fa-
cilitated the sessions using a structured interview guide
(Additional file 1) that was pilot tested for clarity with
patients from an allergy clinic at McMaster University.
Each interview lasted 30–40 minutes and consisted of 
open-ended questions about participants’  experiences
with their child’s first food related reaction. Interviews
were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative
analyses were guided by the constant comparative
method of grounded theory methodology [24].  Groun-
ded theory is a method of systematically analyzing qua-
litative data using codes and categories allowing
researchers to generate theories based on their data.
This methodology is very useful in facilitating the under-
standing of a phenomenon that has not previously been
studied (i.e., how parents or caregivers of children with a
first episode food allergy perceive their follow-up visit
and their expectations of what should happen),  and it
enables the exploration of the ways in which the “reality”
of the follow-up visit is socially constructed [24].  Data
was coded from transcripts using a process of open,
axial and selecting coding using NVivo 9 software (QSR
International, 2011).  Two investigators independently
developed a coding scheme by identifying, classifying
and labeling the primary content patterns and then iden-
tified themes.
Results
Phase 1: survey
Of 293 people who accessed the survey, 208 participants
(71%) were eligible (newly diagnosed) and 184 partici-
pants (63%)  consented and completed the survey.
Seventy-one percent of the respondents were residents
of the province of Ontario; the remainder were from 8
other provinces across Canada. The mean age of the par-
ticipants’  children was 3.5 years (range 1 month to
17 years).  The top four food allergens were peanut
(46%), tree nuts (17%), milk (13%), and egg (8%).
First encounter with a health care professional
At the time of the first food reaction, 51% of participants
took their children to the ED, while the remainder went
to family physicians (21%),  pediatricians (7%),  walk-in
clinics (5%),  allergists (1%),  and nurse practitioners
(1.3%). Twenty-one participants (11%) did not take their
child to any health care professional. Sixty-two percent
of respondents were given the diagnosis of food allergy
at the first encounter, of which 43% received information
about epinephrine auto-injectors. First prescription for
an epinephrine auto-injector was provided by ED physi-
cians (35%), family physicians (21%), paediatricians (6%),
and walk-in clinics (1%). The remainder of participants
(37%) were given a prescription at the appointment with
the allergist. EpiPen® was the most commonly
recommended auto-injector (88%). Participants received
instruction on how to use an auto-injector from aller-
gists (59%), pharmacists (28%), nurses (13%), or ED phy-
sicians (8%); while 10% of participants were self-taught.

Provision of information and education
At the first reaction, participants received information
on allergen avoidance (67%), symptom recognition (51%)
and treatment of a reaction (49%).  Most information
was delivered in the form of reading materials (46%).
Nearly one quarter of respondents (23%) did not receive
any information at the first encounter. Other take-home
resources included referral to allergy organizations
(28%),  auto-injector websites (21%), auto-injector train-
ing devices (46%),  and auto-injector video demonstra-
tions (27%). Allergists were cited as the main provider of
resources and information on the management of allergy
and anaphylaxis. When asked about the desirability of
an educational program after a first reaction, 85% of re-
spondents were interested, and suggested topics such as
recognizing an allergic reaction, treating an allergic reac-
tion, teaching others about food allergy, reading food la-
bels, and coping with anxiety. Their preferred method of
receiving this information was reading materials and on-
line resources.
Referrals and allergy testing
The most common specialist referral by ED physicians
and family physicians was to an allergist (77%); followed
by pediatricians (25%).  Of 142 patients who were re-
ferred, 41% received a food allergy diagnosis from the al-
lergist, 13% from the pediatrician, and 11% from the
family physician. Most participants (89%) were able to
see an allergist within six months; 60% were seen
within 2 months. Of 124 participants who received al-
lergy testing, most received a skin prick test (93%),
followed by food specific serum IgE (28%) and oral food
challenge (5%).
Experience of the first reaction
Most participants (84%) recalled being anxious to ex-
tremely anxious at the time of first diagnosis. At each
step of the care received, many participants (62%) felt
that they did not receive enough information about food
allergy and anaphylaxis management, epinephrine auto-
injectors, and coping strategies. As a consequence of
their child’s reaction to food, participants avoided eating
out at restaurants (85%), restricted their child’s activities
with other children (61%), avoided travel (49%), reduced
their work hours (13%), or quit their job in response to
the diagnosis (11%).  Other lifestyle changes included
moving their child to another school or daycare, moving
to a different neighbourhood or home schooling their
child. Many families reported high levels of anxiety re-
garding the recognition and management of allergic
reactions and anaphylaxis, even though the average
score for their level of confidence on these topics was
above 2.5 on a 4-point scale (0 being no confidence
and 4 being very confident). 
Phase 2: qualitative phone interviews
Ten respondents participated in semi-structured phone
interviews, and 7 completed a paper questionnaire with
identical questions. All participants were parents of chil-
dren with food allergies. Table 1 shows the characteris-
tics of the 17 participants (mean age of children at the
time of the first reaction was 3 years [range 6 months to
10 years]).  Almost 60% of these reactions were due to
peanuts or tree nuts.
Three major themes were identified: 1) prolonged wait
times to see an allergist for definitive diagnosis, 2) lack
of information on symptom recognition and manage-
ment, and 3) significant family anxiety.
Theme 1: first encounter with a health care professional
About half of respondents stated that their physicians
lacked knowledge on the recognition, diagnosis, and man-
agement of food allergy. Only one patient was referred dir-
ectly from the ED to an allergist, while the remainder was
referred to the family physician or pediatrician. Of the 8
respondents who saw their family physician, 6 felt that
their doctor was not well informed:
“I had previously been happy with his care but feel
that he ’dropped the ball' on this one.”
Most participants (94%) were referred to an allergist,
although this did not always occur on the first visit after
the food allergic episode. Some parents had to convince
their physicians to refer their child to an allergist.
“I don’t think she … actually believed that my daughter
had an allergy. She, at first was a bit reluctant to send
us and then she said okay, I’ll send you”

Theme 2: provision of information
Of 14 participants who indicated lack of provision of
information after the first reaction, 76% described hav-
ing to find information on their own. Although their
experiences in the ED varied, they all shared a similar
experience of leaving without knowing how to manage
the food allergy.
“We weren’t given any information or told: ‘maybe
this is what it is, if he is allergic, these are maybe
some of the precautions or this is what you need to
do from here’”.
Only 2 participants reported not receiving information
from their family physician; most information was re-
ceived after the allergist visit. All participants searched
online for food allergy information. They were more
likely to simply “Google” the topic rather than seek
specific allergy and anaphylaxis sites, unless directed by
health professionals or friends. Participants expressed
the need for better education and its dissemination
(i.e.,  reading material, referral to support groups or
follow-up with a nurse), as many experienced difficulty
absorbing all the information at their first encounter
with a health care professional.
Theme 3: family anxiety and lifestyle changes
Nearly all participants (94%) experienced anxiety after
their child’s first reaction:
“The frightening part was what could have been. And
so that was a shock to the system, that I had
nightmares for weeks on end after that…”
In response to the anxiety they felt, participants made
lifestyle changes socially (88%) or at school (35%). A re-
current theme was significant anxiety regarding family
gatherings and other family members feeding their
food-allergic child.
“Just to relieve my own anxiety, I’ve turned into a
control freak and I’ve had to have all the family
gatherings at my house so at least I know that
everything is safe.”
Other lifestyle changes were the exclusion of their
children from birthday parties and restaurants. Eight
participants reported significant difficulties eating out-
side of the home. In the school and daycare environ-
ment, three parents felt comforted with the strict
“no-food sharing” policies at their daycares but many
worried about kindergarten and beyond where there
is less supervision during meals. 
Discussion
Anxiety resulting from the experience of a first food
allergic reaction was the predominant theme identified
in this study. Other important findings were the lack of
provision of information and education about food
allergy and anaphylaxis management, and lengthy wait
times for referral to allergists. Allergists were the most
common source for educational resources on food al-
lergy, anaphylaxis, and epinephrine auto-injectors. This
is significant since patients wait for months to see an
allergist, and have little information and education in
the interim. This is an area on which to focus to ensure
that primary care and first line health care workers are
educated, and dispense appropriate material to patients
and families.
The study also identified a large proportion of indi-
viduals who were not receiving information on proper
management of their child’s condition. Despite a certain
level of confidence in managing food allergic reactions
(as reflected by an average score of 2.5 on a 4 point
scale of confidence in these topics in the online survey),
a significant level of anxiety still exists amongst parents
and caregivers. One reason may be the nature of the
condition, where parents must initiate lifesaving treat-
ment prior to receiving medical attention. In the study
by Gupta et al., they similarly showed good parent base-
line knowledge on food allergy but also demonstrated
many misconceptions about the topic [25].  The other
important finding is that parents and caregivers pre-
ferred education and information in the form of written
and online materials. These resources are already avail-
able from patient websites such as Anaphylaxis Canada
([URL: "http://www.anaphylaxis.ca/"] www.anaphylaxis.ca), and Anaphylaxis Campaign (UK)
([URL: "http://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/"] www.anaphylaxis.org.uk),  and through information
packages from Health Canada ([URL: "http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/"] www.hc-sc.gc.ca), Allergy/
Asthma Information Association ([URL: "http://www.aaia.ca/"] www.aaia.ca),  and the
Food Allergy Research & Education ([URL: "http://www.foodallergy.org/"] www.foodallergy.org).
Caregiver knowledge gaps may also be related to the lack of
awareness of front-line health care workers regarding avail-
able resources.
Figure 1 shows the model for how survey participants
were provided education after a first allergic reaction.
The model reflects the delay in education and resources
as identified by participants, with the heavier weighted
arrows indicating where most patients receive informa-
tion and education. We propose an alternate model
(Figure 2),  which shows the provision of education to
patients and their caregivers earlier in the process,
which may facilitate more effective dissemination of in-
formation. These models depict the continuum of care
and provision of education, incorporating the infor-
mation from various time points (elucidated from both
the quantitative and qualitative data) from first reaction
to diagnosis.

Figure 1 Provision of education as indicated by study participants.
To our knowledge, this is the first mixed-methods
study to investigate parent and caregiver perspectives on
their child’s first food allergic reaction, and to examine
what information and resources they were given and at
what point in their care this occurred. Previous studies
have examined the individual patient experiences [26],
and many have investigated the quality of life of patients
and their families experiencing allergic reactions and
anaphylaxis [27-29]. Other studies have assessed the in-
formation needs of families, thus identifying similar in-
formation gaps (i.e. anaphylaxis management) [17,20],
and the need for educational resources for patients and
their families [30,31]. With the use of a mixed-methods
design, we are able to confirm our survey findings with
those from the qualitative interviews, which allowed us
to generate a continuum of care, incorporating multiple
healthcare interactions at various time points. The data
also shows the time points in the continuum of care 
where patient and family experience of the first episode
of allergic reactions may be improved (i.e. at the first
health care encounter). Finally, results identify the need
for the shift of the education and resource provision
from being an end point (i.e. after allergist assessment)
to a continuous delivery of care (i.e. at every contact in
the continuum).
There are a number of limitations with this study.
Firstly, the survey participants were primarily from
Ontario, representing a  potential selection bias—
approximately 40% of the Canadian population resides
within Ontario compared with 71% of our participants.
This likely reflects the composition of the Anaphylaxis
Canada membership database, which composed our
sample population. To counteract this potential bias, we
recruited an equal proportion of participants from across
Canada to participate in the qualitative telephone inter-
views. The fact that membership of the Anaphylaxis

Canada mailing list is voluntary basis may have also
biased our sample as these families were likely more mo-
tivated. Another limitation is that the diagnosis is based
on self-report and did not require any medical confirm-
ation. In addition, the phase one survey did not require
an answer for each question, resulting in some missing
data. However, the average response rate was 79% for
each question. The survey was also Internet-based and
only accessible to those with Internet access. Another
potential source of bias is the fact that participants were
not excluded if they had prior experience with food al-
lergy personally or with another child. If there is a sig-
nificant portion with prior experience then they may be
more knowledgeable than the general population. Hence,
there may an underestimation in the knowledge gaps. Fi-
nally, the major issue of wait times may be a reflection
of the single payer health care system used within
Canada, so the results may not be generalizable to differ-
ent health care models in other countries.
Next steps of our work will include using the study
findings to 1) inform the development of educational
strategies for patients newly diagnosed with food allergy
(e.g. placement of resources in primary care offices and
urgent care settings, educational programs for primary
care physicians and allied health, and promoting online
resources); 2) to improve the direct referral of patients
from the ED to an allergist and the provision of epineph-
rine auto injector prescription and information in these
settings; and 3) to develop strategies to improve the flow
and speed that patients and families are moved through
the continuum of care from the first encounter to formal
diagnosis by the allergist.
Understandably, emergency rooms cannot have in-
formation for every food allergen available but more
general documents such as signs and symptoms of
anaphylaxis as well as proper use of epinephrine auto
injectors can be easily made available. In addition, this
information sheet can have websites to refer patients
and caregivers for further information including Ana-
phylaxis Canada ([URL: "http://www.anaphylaxis.ca/"] www.anaphylaxis.ca),  Health Canada
([URL: "http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/"] www.hc-sc.gc.ca), Allergy/Asthma Information Associ-
ation ([URL: "http://www.aaia.ca/"] www.aaia.ca),  and the Food Allergy Research &
Education ([URL: "http://www.foodallergy.org/"] www.foodallergy.org).  This would be in
keeping with other forms of educational materials dis-
tributed at the emergency room. In addition, there can
be a hesitation by emergency room physicians to make
the direct referral due to the concerns of not keeping
the primary care physician in the continuum of care.
This can be addressed by including the primary care
physicians name within the referral letter as the phys-
ician who will be following the patient on discharge.
This is currently used on other direct from ER refer-
rals to services such as asthma education at some chil-
dren’s hospitals in Canada. 
Conclusions
This mixed methods study highlighted the multiple defi-
ciencies that exist at different levels of the health system
for caregivers of children with a first food allergic reac-
tion. Qualitative interviews reinforced survey results
demonstrating a lack of information on food allergy
management, when it is most needed, namely at the
start of care (i.e., during ED and family physician visits).
Findings will inform the development of educational
strategies to address these gaps.
