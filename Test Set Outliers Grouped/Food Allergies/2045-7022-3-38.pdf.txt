Elicitors and co-factors in food-induced
anaphylaxis in adults

Abstract
Food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA) in adults is often insufficiently diagnosed. One reason is related to the presence of
co-factors like exercise, alcohol, additives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The objective of this analysis
was to retrospectively investigate the role of co-factors in patients with FIA. 93 adult patients with suspected FIA
underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges with suspected allergens and co-factors.
The elicitors of anaphylaxis were identified in 44/93 patients. 27 patients reacted to food allergens upon challenge,
15 patients reacted only when a co-factor was co-exposed with the allergen. The most common identified allergens
were celery (n = 7), soy, wheat (n = 4 each) and lupine (n = 3). Among the co-factors food additives (n = 8) and
physical exercise (n = 6) were most frequent. In 10 patients more than one co-factor and/or more than one food
allergen was necessary to elicit a positive reaction.
The implementation of co-factors into the challenge protocol increases the identification rate of elicitors in adult
food anaphylactic patients.

Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction
[1]. The most common triggers of food-induced anaphyl-
axis (FIA) are tree nuts, peanuts, fish, crustacean, cow´s
milk and hen´s egg [2]. Co-factors may contribute to the
elicitation of a severe allergic reaction [2,3].  Therefore
these factors should be considered in the diagnostic work-
up of oral food challenges. Reported co-factors are e.g.
physical exercise, drugs, infections, psychological stress,
alcohol but also food additives [2-4].
Herein we report on large series of FIA patients who
underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled food chal-
lenges (DBPCFC) to identify the eliciting allergen and
relevant co-factors as part of routine clinical care.

We retrospectively assessed data from patients with sus-
pected FIA who presented at the Allergy-Centre-Charité

analysis were the onset of at least one severe pulmonary
and/or one severe cardiovascular symptom in combin-
ation with the onset of gastrointestinal and/or skin
symptoms. All patients were subjected to skin prick test
(SPT) with commercial allergen extracts and with native
materials (prick to prick) as described [5]. If suspected
food allergens were not covered by the standard panel,
additional SPTs were performed. Total immunoglobulin
E (tIgE), specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) and tryptase
were determined with ImmunoCAP System Thermo
Fisher Scientific (Uppsala, Sweden).
The DBPCFC were given titrated in five steps in-
creasing 10-fold from 0.01 g to the total (cumulative)
dose. The cumulative dose of fruits was 50 g, of tree
nuts and peanuts 10 g, of soy and cow´s milk 200 ml
and of cereals 100 g. The time interval between the first
and the second dose was 15 min, between the following
doses 30 min each. The food allergens used in the
provocation tests were blinded. The basis ingredient of
all meals was a hypoallergenic infant formula (Nestlé
Nutrition GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Blinding
was achieved with several ingredients like peppermint-
syrup (Monin, Bourges, Frankreich) cocoa powder (Krüger
GmbH, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany),  orange-flavour or

blackcurrant-flavour (SHS Gesellschaft für klinische
Ernährung mbH, Heilbronn, Germany), oat- or rice-flakes
(Demeter, Bauckhof, Darmstadt, Germany).  The relation
of verum and placebo challenges was 1:1. It was paused
two hours between the different food challenges (whether
placebo or verum).
If the suspected food allergen elicited no allergic reac-
tion upon challenge and if the patient’s history indicated
a possible role of co-factors, these were integrated into
the DBPCFC. Co-factors were applied separately before
the combination with the suspected food allergen. Exer-
cise was applied 60 min after food intake. The length and
intensity of physical activity was based on patient’s history
and reached from 15 min to 60 min on a treadmill. Acetyl-
salicylic acid (ASA) was applied 60 min before food intake
and doses were given according to patient´s history
reaching from 100 to 500 mg. Alcohol was applied
10 min before and the food additives 30 min before the
sequential food challenge. The food-additives were
challenged all together with a capsule exposure includ-
ing coloring agents (E 110, 122, 124, 151, 104, 127, 131,
132, 172, 120, 5 mg each; E102, 50 mg), preservatives
(E 200, 211, 214, 1000 mg each; E223, 251, 100 mg
each),  antioxidants (E320, 321, 310, 306–309, 50 mg
each), taste enhancer (E621, 500 mg), naturally occurring
substances (salicylic acid, 100 mg). The placebo capsules
were filled with mannit and silicium dioxide. Data pro-
cessing and analysis was done with SPSS 19.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Ninety three patients with the diagnosis of suspected
FIA were included into this analysis (32 male, median

age: 42 years) (Figure 1). 44 patients had positive challenge
tests. 27 patients developed symptoms after the food aller-
gen challenge and 15 reacted only after combining the
food allergen with co-factors. Two patients reacted to
the suspected co-factors only (diclofenac and pantozol)
(Figure 1).  Upon challenge most patients developed
only cutaneous and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (67%)
whereas in real life (upon history) reactions were more
severe with 100% of patients showing respiratory or/and
cardiovascular symptoms.

The most common food allergen was celery (n = 7)
followed by wheat, soy (n = 4 each) and lupine (n = 3),
(Table 1).  These food allergens were also the most
common suspected elicitors of anaphylaxis (wheat in 41
patients, celery in 40, soy in 21 and lupine in 14
patients). In 5 patients the combination of one co-factor
with a single food allergen induced an allergic reaction
(Table 2). In 7 patients more than one co-factor or more
than one food allergen was required to induce a positive
reaction. Three patients required the presence of 2 or 3
co-factors in combination with 2 or 3 food allergens to
induce the reaction. Food additives (n = 8), physical exer-
cise (n = 6), ASA (n = 4), alcohol (n = 3) and clindamycin
(n = 1) were identified as co-factors. Among food aller-
gens in combination with co-factors, wheat (n = 10) 
most frequently induced anaphylaxis followed by celery
(n = 6), seafood (n = 3) and hazelnut (n = 2).
The values of SPT, sIgE and total IgE were distributed
similar between positive and negative challenge results
(Figure 2). In 4 patients tryptase (>11.5 μg/l) were ele-
vated, but below 20 μg/l, an underlying mastocytosis was
excluded by a thorough inspection of the skin.
Discussion
In 16% of patients with anaphylaxis the co-exposure of
co-factors with food-allergens was necessary to elicit a
reaction. The underlying pathomechanism of co-factors
in FIA is not known, but an impairment of the gastrodu-
odenal permeability leading to an increased absorption
of allergens has been discussed [6].

The finding that in real life reactions were more severe
than upon challenge can be explained due to the fact
that for safety reasons the challenge meals were given
titrated and the supervised food challenges were stopped
immediately when objective symptoms occurred.
The most common single food allergen causing ana-
phylaxis was celery, which is in line with previous data
[7].  Celery has been reported in conjunction with co-
factors to induce anaphylaxis previously [7,8]. However,
the most frequent reported food allergen in combin-
ation with co-factors is wheat and wheat-dependent
exercise-induced anaphylaxis is well known. Neverthe-
less other food allergens e.g. tree nuts have been re-
ported to induce allergic reactions in combination with
physical exercise as well [6]. Why exercise is a frequent
co-factor in wheat allergy is not known. An increased
stability of wheat allergens to gastrointestinal enzymes
resulting in an increased absorption upon physical activity
may be relevant [9].
Some patients reacted only when multiple co-factors
and several food allergens were present. This observation
has only been described in single case-reports previously.
Aihara et al. reported the requirement of the simultaneous
intake of two food allergens to provoke food-dependent
exercise-induced anaphylaxis [10]. The additive effect of
co-factors has been described for exercise together with
ASA as well [6] and we reported previously a case, where
wheat, exercise, alcohol and food additives were necessary
to elicit the reaction [4]. Despite the complex procedure
to evaluate co-factors in clinical practice, their role should
be analysed in prospective controlled clinical trials to
unravel how frequent they are in unselected patient
populations.
DBPCFC can be performed in patients with FIA, al-
though there is a potential risk for severe reactions. In
47% of the patients the cause and circumstances to elicit
their reaction were identified. Considering co-factors for
the challenge protocol and including them in provocation
tests with previously negative results we increased the rate
of positive reactions. Although, the underlying mechanism
is not yet understood, the implementation of co-factors
into current challenge protocols seem to be worthwhile to
improve the identification rate of elicitors in adult patients
with FIA.
