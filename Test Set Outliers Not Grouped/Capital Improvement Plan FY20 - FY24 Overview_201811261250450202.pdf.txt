Capital Improvement Plan 
FY20-FY24
Overview
Investing in our capital infrastructure is essential to the efficient operation of the City. Whether the investment
is in our water and sewer pipes and pump stations, or our roads and bridges, or our government and school
1 | P a g e

buildings, and all the equipment that helps us complete our work, an effective maintenance, repair and
replacement plan is critical. The capital needs of the City total for the five year period FY20 - FY24 total $312.9
million. The dollars broken down by fund is illustrated in the chart and graph below:

The general parameters for decision-making was to hit the highest departmental priorities within a budget value
that would stay within out debt service goal and be could be successfully managed by departments. Many
projects are restricted by the weather, by location, be the construction season demand for contractors and
materials. The financial impact on the annual operating budget is also an important factor, since every dollar we
use for support the debt associated with this plan is a dollar we don’t have service operations. However, 
financing is the majority of this plan is a cost effective way of fulfilling our responsibility to maintain our capital
infrastructure. Sine we are financing a majority of this plan, it is also important to look at that impact over a five
year period and not one year at a time. Our financial capacity to borrow requires this extended view of the
finances (debt service costs) associated with the Capital Improvement Plan. More detail on debt service is
included further on in this overview. 
One very important component of the CIP is equipment. Properly working equipment is absolutely necessary to
the successful execution and completion of a daily operations, in house capital maintenance and improvements. 
It is critical to the removal of trash and recycling from our neighborhoods, plowing and removal of snow form
roads and sidewalks which allows for safe passage of vehicles, school buses and children to school and work. 
The CIP Includes much needed rolling (sidewalk tractors, dump trucks, fire engines) and non-rolling (firefighter
3 | P a g e 
Page 4
air packs, pump station equipment) equipment replacement for assets ranging in age from 10 years old to 22
years old. Requests for rolling and non-rolling equipment totals $26 million in both General and Utility Funds
over the course of this five year span. If FY20 alone these categories total $8.3 million. 
The second most significant part of the CIP is the investment in buildings. The Plan calls for $75.6 million in
building structure and building mechanical repairs, replacements and renovations. In FY20, these requests total
$9.9 million. 
One reason the CIP is as expensive as it is, is because Framingham deferred action on regular capital investment
for maintenance and repair and equipment replacement for many years. We are at a point now where some
buildings are uninhabitable, equipment has failed and is unsafe and cannot be used. However, the backlog is so
daunting and expensive, we cannot do it all. We make progress in an affordable manner. 
The Capital Improvement Plan recommends authorizing projects for FY20 in both the General fund and Utility
Enterprise fund. The General fund recommendation is 33% of the $41 million requested. The Utility Enterprise
Fund recommendation is 91% of the $14.7 million requested. The total recommended is $13.4 million for the
combined water and Sewer Departments in the Utility Enterprise Fund and $13.4 million for nine Divisions in the
General Fund.

The CIP need is high in all Divisions – the goal was to allocate funds fairly to address as many
Divisions/Departments as possible, as equitably as we could. Some Division responsibilities are significant, for
example Public Works. They manage roads, storm water mitigation, intersection design, sidewalks, trash and
recycling removal and snow plowing and removal; overseen by the Engineering, Highway, Sanitation and Fleet

Departments. The total request for this division was more than $30.5 million, based on multiple master plans
for roads and storm water, industry standards for equipment repair and replacement.

Debt Service Impact on the Estimated Operating Budget
Debt service is the annual payment required to satisfy the bonds we issue to pay for the CIP. We generally
borrow twice a year: in June for short term cash (BANS) to cover the summer construction schedule; and
December to permanently borrow (bonds) once we have permanently expended for projects and purchases
during the year. The estimate for debt service for the CIP will have to be updated once the final borrowing cycle
is completed in mid-December. The extended projection assumes that there is some deferral projects – not
everything can be authorized, same as any year. The General fund worksheet is in green and is followed by a
similar debt service worksheet for the Utility Enterprise fund, broken down by water and sewer. There is no
policy cap for debt service for the Enterprise fund. We have watched over the last ten years how much we have
5 | P a g e 
Page 6
been required by the state to invest in the water and sewer systems. Now that some of the ACO enforcement
as eased up, we have moved from CIP budgets of $20-$30 million to CIP budgets of $14-$16 million. 
Note that we can reduce incurring debt service by using cash to pay directly for projects and purchases rather
than finance them. In this CIP for FY20 we use $484,800 in free cash to fund four projects. They are highlighted
as free cash in the “Funding Source” field in thedatabase. 
As a Town we had a policy the capped debt service spending to 5% of the total budget. The Department of
Revenue advises a cap of 15%, so our policy is very conservative. Still, we need to stick to it if we also want to
have an adequate level of operating budget resources to fund taxpayer services such has public health, public
safety, trash, recycling and snow removal, permitting and zoning enforcement, library services, veterans’ 
services human resources and financial management and, finally, education of our children. 
Note, that in these worksheet we take into consideration all borrowing: what has been bonded already and an
estimate for what is authorized but hasn’t been borrowed yet. This is called “authorized and unissued”. This
number is an estimate based on the progress of existing capital projects. We are trying to determine an amount
we will actually spend in the year designated, and not over budget.

Because we try to map out the debt service costs not by the year authorized but in the year we would actually
be required to spend it; the annual debt service projection is reduced. The charts below indicate the difference
between what the CIP 5 year requests incur for debt service and the more realistic recommendations for FY20
and the period FY21-24.

Closing
While this is a comprehensive Capital Improvement Plan, don’t be lulled into a sense that we are making major
progress with our capital plan. We defer much more than we should, but cannot afford to do much more within
the limitations of the general fund tax levy and pressure on the utility rates. We should be investing more, and
certainly the needs/condition of our buildings, all buildings, will force us to make some critical decisions within
the next year. We are providing resources to prepare for that – but it doesn’t make the decision any easier
knowing all the data. 
Accessing the CIP
The Capital Improvement Plan documents are provided in electronic format only. The
capital project data is actually housed in a Smartsheet database “in the cloud”. All the
supporting documentation is attached within the database. Access to the database will
be via a link emailed to you by the Assistant CFO, Jennifer Pratt. The debt service
information, including the worksheets included in this narrative, will be emailed directly
to you by the CFO, Mary Ellen Kelley. The CFO and Assistant CFO are available to
provide additional information or help you access Smartsheet or the other files.
