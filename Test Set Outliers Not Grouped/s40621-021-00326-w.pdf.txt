Abstract
Background: Nearly half of the sudden deaths documented in Japanese middle and high school occurred during
school organized sport activities. However, no study to date has calculated the incidence rates of these deaths by
sport. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the epidemiology of sudden death in organized school sports in
Japan.
Methods: Data submitted to Japan Sport Council (JSC) Injury and Accident Mutual Aid Benefit System between
2005 and 2016 were retrieved from JSC website for analysis (n = 1137). Case information on fatal incidents that
occurred during organized school sports in middle and high school students were extracted for analysis (n = 198).
Descriptive statistics about activity type, sex, sport, cause of death, and presence of on-site trained medical
personnel were calculated using frequencies and proportions. Sudden death incidence rates were expressed per
100,000 athlete-years with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results: The overall incidence rate of sports-related death was 0.38 deaths per 100,000 athlete-years (95%CI = 0.30,
0.45). Only three cases (2%) reported having trained medical personnel on-site at the time of death. Most deaths were
in male student athletes (n = 149/162, 92%), with 7.5 times greater fatality rate in male compared to female student
athletes (incidence rate ratio, 7.5; 95%CI = 4.43, 13.22). Baseball (n = 25/162, 15.4%), judo (n = 24/162, 14.8%), soccer/
futsal (n = 20/162, 12.3%), and basketball (n = 18/162, 11.1%) accounted for 53.7% of deaths. Accounting for the
number of participants in the respective sport, the three highest average incident rates of death were reported in
rugby (4.59 deaths per 100,000 athlete-years, 95%CI = 2.43, 6.75), judo (3.76 deaths per 100,000 athlete-years, 95%CI =
1.58, 5.93), and baseball (0.59 deaths per 100,000 athlete-years, 95%CI = 0.38, 0.79). The top three causes of death were
sudden cardiac arrest (n = 68/162, 42.0%), head trauma (n = 32/162, 19.8%), and heat related injury (n = 25/162, 15.4%).
Conclusions: In conclusion, the highest rates of sports-related death among Japanese student athletes were observed
in the following: rugby, male athletes, and during practices. The leading cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest.

Background
School organized sport participation provides a valuable
opportunity for students to stay physically active, start a
new sport, and fosters psychosocial growth in the form
of teamwork, leadership, and accountability. Japan
Sports Agency and Japanese school systems have
regarded school organized sport as an extension of
formal education that is supervised and coached by
faculty members of the school (Japan Sport Agency
2018; Nakazawa 2014). Participation in school organized
sport is often viewed as an introduction to an active life-
style to extend a healthy life span (Hallal et al. 2006;
Monma et al. 2019);  however, it could also predispose
student athletes to sustain injuries that may range from
minor to fatal (Kamiya et al. 2015; Kuroyanagi et al.
2001; Miyake et al. 2016; Takagishi et al. 2019;
Takahashi et al. 2019).
Death of a student athlete during school organized
sport not only impacts the victim’s family and team,
but the community at large. According to Japan Sport
Council (JSC) Injury and Accident Mutual Aid Benefit
System, middle and high schools documented an
average of 360 claims for catastrophic and fatal inci-
dents each year from school sanctioned activities from
2015 to 2018, 46% of which were related to sport
participation (outside of physical education) (Japan
Sport Council n.d.-a).  School nurse may be on call
afterschool when school organized sports take place;
however, the level of access varies greatly by school.
In addition, current school safety guidelines set forth
by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
and Technology focus on community safety, traffic
safety, and natural disaster safety but not sports-
specific safety considerations. Therefore, school
administration, staff, and faculty are not equipped
with knowledge and skills regarding prevention and
management of sport-specific emergencies. Conse-
quently, when fatal sports incidents do occur, they
are managed in a reactive fashion, where cases are
examined retrospectively to identify the mechanisms
and causes of death through interviews, but often fall
short on implementing proactive risk mitigation
strategies. At the time of the current study, no na-
tionwide policy has specifically aimed to improve
health and safety of student athletes in the context of
school organized sport participation.
Each year, JSC Injury and Accident Mutual Aid Benefit
System receives insurance claims data from schools for
catastrophic and fatal incidents that occurred during
school sanctioned events (Japan Sport Council n.d.-a).
The mutual aid benefit system covers medical expenses
and compensation for injuries or death, if the accident
that results in injury, illness, disability, or death occurred
under the supervision of schools. The liability for the 
premium is borne by the national government, school,
and parents and guardians, and eligibility for benefits
applies regardless of the school’s liability. After the
student-athlete is discharged from the hospital, parents
and guardians will submit necessary medical record in-
formation to the school, who will process the mutual aid
benefit system application to JSC. The benefit will be
paid out to the parents and guardians of the insuree if
the claim application is submitted to JSC within 2 years
of the incident. Ninety-five percent of the students of
both public and private institutions nationwide (e.g.,
compulsory education schools, high schools, kindergar-
ten, nursery school) subscribe to this mutual aid benefit
system with 99.9 and 97.8% of middle and high school
students, respectively, covered under this system (Japan
Sport Council n.d.-b).  No study to date has examined
the incidence of sport-related death using the current
dataset.
Methods
A retrospective epidemiology study design was used to
describe the epidemiology of sudden death in organized
middle school and high school sports in Japan.
Data sources
Insurance claims submitted to JSC Injury and Accident
Mutual Aid Benefit System between 2005 and 2016 were
retrieved from JSC website for analysis (n = 1137).  The
database is publicly accessible on the website (Japan
Sport Council n.d.-a).  Case information on fatal inci-
dents occurring during organized school sports in mid-
dle and high school students were extracted by YH for
further analysis (n = 198). In Japan, middle school covers
grades 7th through 9th (12 to 15 years old) and high
school covers grades 10th through 12th (15 to 18 years
old).  Data categorization used in the JSC database was
used in this study for: activity type (practice, scrimmage,
game, training camp, other), sport (badminton, baseball,
basketball, boxing, cycling, fencing, gymnastics, handball,
hiking, ice hockey, judo, kendo, kyudo, rugby ski, soccer,
softball, swim table tennis, track and field [long distance,
pole vault, short distance, throwing],  volleyball, wrest-
ling, other) and cause of death (cervical spine trauma,
drowning, head trauma, heat related injury, internal
organ trauma, lightning, sudden cardiac arrest, suffoca-
tion, and unknown cause). Cause of death was registered
in the database by JSC staff according to the medical
diagnosis provided by the physician in the medical
records submitted by the insuree.
Population data for middle and high school student
athletes were retrieved from public online databases
of national governing bodies that manage the mem-
bership data of these athletes annually (All Japan
High School Athletic Federation, 2017; Nippon Junior
Page 3
Hosokawa et al. Injury Epidemiology (2021) 8:27  Page 3 of 7
High School Physical Culture Association n.d.-a; Nip-
pon Junior High School Physical Culture Associ-
ation n.d.-b). Due to missing data in some years from
the publicly available data source, data from 2016 was
used as the estimate of participant numbers in all
years. Since high school baseball is governed by Japan
High School Baseball Federation, membership data
was retrieved separately from its official website
(Japan High School Baseball Federation n.d.).
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics related to information about activ-
ity type, sex, sport, cause of death, and presence of on-
site trained medical personnel were calculated using fre-
quencies and proportions. Presence of on-site trained
medical personnel was determined by YH from review-
ing case details. Sudden death incidence rates were
expressed per 100,000 athlete-years (AY) with 95% con-
fidence intervals (CI). Incidence rates overall and by gen-
der were calculated using the total number of middle
and high school student athletes in the rate denomin-
ator. Incidence rate ratio and 95% CI between male and
female student athletes was also calculated. Sport-
specific incidence rates were calculated for sports with
five or more reported deaths, and utilized the number of
participants in the sport in the rate denominator. Fish-
er’s exact test (FET) with Monte Carlo simulation was
used to examine the pattern in the proportion of re-
ported causes of death (sudden cardiac arrest, head
trauma, heat related injury, and all other causes of 
death) over the 12-year period. A significance level of
p < 0.05 was set a priori.
Results
Fatalities were reported during practice (n = 120/198,
60.6%), scrimmage (n = 16/198, 8.1%), game (n = 10/198,
5.1%), training camp (n = 16/198, 8.1%), and other (n =
36/198, 18.2%). For the remainder of the analysis, fatal-
ities that occurred during other activities were removed
from the analysis since they either (1) did not have fur-
ther details to suggest that they occurred during prac-
tice, scrimmage, game, or training camp, or (2) the
report suggested that they occurred during the down-
time of sport participation (e.g., found dead in bed the
morning after the practice, motor vehicle accident on
the way to athletic venue).
The overall incidence rate of sports-related death was
0.38 deaths per 100,000 AY (highest, 0.56 deaths per
100,000 AY; lowest, 0.19 deaths per 100,000 AY). Most
fatalities were in male student athletes (n = 149/162,
92%), with a 7.5 times greater fatality rate (95%CI = 4.43,
13.22) in male compared to female student athletes
(male, 0.60 deaths per 100,000 AY, 95%CI = 0.46, 0.73;
female, 0.08 deaths per 100,000 AY, 95%CI = 0.03, 0.13).
Only three deaths (2%) reported having trained medical
personnel on-site at the time of incident.
Analysis by sport
The number of fatalities by sport is summarized in Fig. 1.

soccer/futsal (n = 20/162, 12.3%), and basketball (n = 18/
162, 11.1%) accounted for 53.7% of fatalities. Incidence
rates per 100,000 AY were calculated for sports with five
or more reported deaths (e.g., baseball, judo, soccer/fut-
sal, basketball, and rugby, tennis, kendo, badminton, and
volleyball). Accounting for the number of participants in
the respective sports, the three highest incident rates of
death were reported in rugby (4.59 deaths per 100,000
AY, 95%CI = 2.43, 6.75),  judo (3.76 deaths per 100,
000AY, 95%CI = 1.58, 5.93),  and baseball (0.59 deaths
per 100,000AY, 95%CI = 0.38, 0.79) (Table 1).
Cause of death
The cause of death during organized school sports is
summarized in Fig. 2. Sudden cardiac arrest (n = 68/162,
42.0%),  head trauma (n = 32/162, 19.8%),  and heat
related injury (n = 25/162, 15.4%) were the top three
known causes of death. The proportion of sudden
cardiac arrest, head trauma, heat related injury, and all
other causes of death varied by year (FET [33] = 46.48,
p = 0.02) (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Examination of deaths that occurred during organized
school sports documented in JSC database between 2005
and 2016 revealed that the overall incidence rate of
sport-related death was 0.38 deaths per 100,000 AY, with
7.5 times greater rate in male compared to female stu-
dent athletes. To our knowledge, this is the first study
reporting the incident rate of death per 100,000 athlete-
years during organized school sports in Japan. A previ-
ous study by Kuroyanagi et al. examined sudden deaths
documented in elementary, middle, and high school stu-
dents of the twenty-three special wards of Tokyo
between 1976 and 1995 (Kuroyanagi et al. 2001). In their
study, a total of 255 deaths were reported, of which 43 
deaths happened during participation in school orga-
nized sports on campus. However, the incident rate per
student-years was not calculated, and the sex difference
was reported using a ratio (i.e., male to female ratio of
reported death was 2 to 1),  which does not provide a
valid sex comparison since the total number of male
participants was greater than that of female.
The three leading causes of death during organized
school sports in Japan were comparable with those re-
ported in the United States: sudden cardiac arrest, head
trauma, and heat related injury (Boden et al. 2013; Casa
et al. 2012b).  This is an expected finding since sport-
related deaths tend to occur during extreme exertion or
from direct trauma (Boden et al. 2013).  However, it
should be noted that an ethnicity-based difference was
observed in the absence of exertional sickling related
death in our Japanese cohort; a risk factor commonly
seen in people of African descent that is often associ-
ated with death when a training that is too novel, too
much, too soon, or too intense is implemented (Casa
et al. 2012a).
When accounting for the number of participants in
the respective sport, rugby (4.59/100,000 AY) and judo
(3.76/100,000 AY) had notably higher incidence rates of
death compared to other sports. Rugby and judo were
also the top two sports in reported numbers of head
trauma deaths, and were the only two sports where the
reported number of deaths due to head trauma exceeded
sudden cardiac arrest (rugby: head trauma n = 6, sudden
cardiac arrest n = 2; judo: head trauma n = 17, sudden
cardiac arrest n = 1). This finding aligns with the high in-
tensity and collision-involving nature of these sports. Re-
cent American football injury research in the United
States, from both media and direct reporting during a
12-year period, indicate that the incidence of sports-
related deaths was 0.79 per 100,000 AY and 3.44 per

100,000 AY for high school and collegiate athletes,
respectively (Kucera et al. 2020).  Although these data
cannot be used as a direct comparison against our study
results due to differences in data collection methods, the
findings in Japan were high because they exceed the rate
observed in collegiate American football, which has the
highest incidence rate of sports-related fatalities in colle-
giate sports in the United States.
There are two factors that may have affected a signifi-
cantly high fatality rate reported in Japan. First, school
organized sports in Japan are played throughout the aca-
demic year (April through March), 5 days a week. Fur-
thermore, training camps, games, and tournaments are
often scheduled during the holiday breaks, and students
take part in the team activity for the duration of their
time at the school (i.e.,  3 years).  Therefore, the total
exposure to organized school activity is much greater in
a given year compared to student athletes in the United
States, where students participate in sports by seasons.
Second, most school organized sports in Japan are solely
supervised and coached by faculty members of the 
school (Nakazawa 2014).  Before the introduction of
external hiring policies (i.e., hiring non-faculty members)
for school extracurricular activities in 2017, faculty
members were assigned to sports that they may or may
not be familiar with. The current analysis presented in
this paper represents the pre-policy period, where such
options were unavailable. According to the report from
the Japan Sports Association, 45.9% of middle school
and 40.9% of high school faculty members who were
assigned to supervise school organized sport teams were
not physical education teachers nor had the experience
of playing the assigned sport (Japan Sports Association
2014). This is of concern as individuals with minimum,
if any, knowledge of the sport and risks associated with
the activity are responsible for the health and safety of
the student athletes. While coaches are members of their
respective sports governing bodies, the lack of regulatory
systems for coaching qualifications at middle and high
school sports makes it difficult to implement standard-
ized coaching education as a requirement. According to
the national survey conducted in 2015, 99% of middle

and 2016

and high schools in Japan have at least one automated
external defibrillator on campus (The Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology-
Japan, 2015);  however, the same survey reported that
only 68.4 and 58.8% of middle and high schools offer
first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training to
all faculty members. This discrepancy further highlights
the lack of human resource and training to ensure the
health and safety of student athletes. Lastly, only three
reported cases in the current study had trained medical
personnel on-site at the time of incident. This is in con-
trast with school organized sports in the United States,
where 86% of athletes have access to certified athletic
trainer for medical services (Pike et al. 2017).  When a
certified athletic trainer was present to assist in the re-
suscitation at the site of sudden cardiac arrest, 83% (24/
29) of athletes survived; whereas the percentage was
lower (47%;  9/19) when a certified athletic trainer was
not present (Drezner et al. 2019).  While we cannot
imply causation from this finding, future improvement
in access to trained medical personnel on campus may
influence the number of sudden cardiac arrest sruvivals.
Sociocultural factors of Japanese school organized
sports should also be considered in when interpreting
results from the current study. A previous study
(Mochizuki and Tomozoe 2016) suggests that origins of
catastrophic injuries in Japanese school organized sports
are due to lack of knowledge among coaches and use of
physical hardship as a pedagogy for development. The
zero tolerance culture for weakness has resulted in delay
in appropriate activity modification and treatment when
student athletes were suffering from potentially lethal
conditions Future research should investigate
organizational risk factors associated with catastrophic
incidents during school organized sports to elucidate fu-
ture strategies for prevention of sports-related fatalities.
Our dataset observed a drop in the number of deaths
in 2008 and 2012 (Fig. 3).  While we cannot make an
inference, 2012 corresponds with the year when Judo
became a required subject in physical education for boys
and girls in middle school nationwide. This change has
brought national attention to safety issues in judo, which
heightened awareness regarding acquisition of proper
skills and designing practice sessions that match the skill
level of novice students. Detailed review of our dataset
revealed that Judo had one fatal head trauma and one
fatal cervical spine trauma from 2012 to 2016, which
was substantially fewer than sixteen deaths reported
between 2005 and 2011. This change in judo alone may
have influenced the drop in the number of deaths from
2012 to 2016.
This study is not without limitations. First, authors re-
trieved the claims data from the publicly accessible data-
base of JSC Injury and Accident Mutual Aid Benefit 
System, (Japan Sport Council n.d.-c) which is not de-
signed for epidemiology research. For example, categor-
ies used to label causes of death in this system were
created by JSC and do not follow code systems often
seen in medical chart and injury surveillance systems.
Additionally, the decision to submit claim information is
made by school personnel, who may or may not have
the ability to correctly identify deaths that occurred due
to school organized sport participation. However, re-
gardless of the shortcomings of the JSC database, it is
the only national database that currently collects com-
prehensive claims reports on catastrophic and fatal in-
juries that resulted in insurance benefit payouts.
Another limitation is our estimate of population data for
rate denominators, which was derived from the member-
ship data from 2016. This estimation does not account
for changes in participation over time which could im-
pact the rates. Furthermore, we did not have data on
school characteristics to examine the confounding vari-
ables that may influence the chance of survival (e.g.,
presence of emergency action plans, accessibility to au-
tomated external defibrillator, number of years coaching
the sport, completion of safety training).  Lastly, future
studies should examine factors that may have influenced
the significantly low incidence rate among female stu-
dent athletes. Previous studies have consistently reported
a lower prevalence of sudden death among female ath-
letes in sports; however, the precise mechanism is not
well-understood (Colombo et al. 2019; Endres et al.
2019; Finocchiaro et al. 2016).  Therefore, more studies
are needed to improve the understanding of the causes
of death among female athletes and to elucidate if differ-
ent risk factors exist when compared to the male
counterpart.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the incidence rate of sports-related death
among Japanese student athletes was highest in male
rugby players, and fatalities most often occurred during
practice and were due to sudden cardiac arrest. The top
three causes of death were sudden cardiac arrest, head
trauma, and heat related injury, accounting for 77.2% of
all reported cases. Therefore, future efforts on preven-
tion and emergency preparedness should prioritize these
conditions. Additionally, few incidents had trained med-
ical personnel on-site at the time of the catastrophic
event during school organized athletics in Japan. These
findings call for national and organizational actions to
reconsider the current structure of school organized
sports and to improve access to medical personnel dur-
ing school organized sports.
