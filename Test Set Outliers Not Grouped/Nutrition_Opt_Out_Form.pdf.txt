Nutrition Opt Out Form
Child Care Rules .0901(d) and .1706(c) state: 
When children bring their own food for meals and snacks to the program, if the food does not meet the
nutritional requirements specified in Paragraph (a) of this Rule, the operator must provide the additional food
necessary to meet those requirements unless the child’s parent or guardian opts out of the supplemental food
provided by the operator as set forth in G.S. 110-91(2) h.1. A statement acknowledging the parental decision
to opt out of the supplemental food provided by the operator signed by the child’s parent or guardian shall be
on file at the facility. Opting out means that the operator will not provide any food or drink so long as the child’s
parent or guardian provides all meals, snacks, and drinks scheduled to be served at the program’s designated
times. If the child’s parent or guardian has opted out but does not provide all food and drink for the child, the
program shall provide supplemental food and drink as if the child’s parent or guardian had not opted out of
the supplemental food program. 
I _____________________________ plan to provide all meals, snacks and 
(Parent/Guardian Print Name) 
drinks for my child and do not want his/her meals, snacks or drinks
supplemented to meet the Meal Patterns for Children in Child Care Programs
from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which are based on
the recommended nutrient intake judged by the National Research Council to be
adequate for maintaining good nutrition. 
Since I opted out, if I do not provide all the meals, snacks or drinks for my child, I
understand that the program will provide supplemental food and drink.
