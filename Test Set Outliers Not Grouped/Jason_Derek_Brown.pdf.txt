Background
Brown was born in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"] Los Angeles, California, on July 1, 1969, to
 David John Brown Sr.[3][4] He attended Laguna Beach High
School.[5] Brown speaks fluent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"] French and has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree"] master's degree
 in international business. He served a mission for The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"] Paris from 1988 to 1990.[3]
Between 1990 and 2004, Brown resided at several places in
 Orange County, California, including Dana Point and the Corona
del Mar neighborhood of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California"] Newport Beach.
Motive
Brown owned two businesses, Toys Unlimited and On The
 Doorstep Advertising, both of which he ran out of his home in Salt
Lake City, Utah.[6] He had been employed as a toy salesman and
 golf equipment importer[7] to support his luxurious lifestyle and
expensive tastes in such things as cars, motorbikes, and boats.[5][8]
Brown portrayed himself as a wealthy man, despite the fact that by
2004 he had [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)"] defaulted on at least one large loan and had racked up

tens of thousands of dollars in debt.[8] It is believed that Brown
operated check and bank fraud scams for years in order to fund the
image that he had created for himself. Phoenix Detective Paul
Brown has stated that Brown may have been the perpetrator of a
number of unsolved petty thefts and home invasions.[9] He would
sometimes go to car dealerships, clean-shaven and well-dressed,
and purchase a car using a false Social Security number and
address.[8]

In November 2004, days after having bought a .45 caliber [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock_pistol"] Glock pistol, Brown took a firearms instruction
course at Totally Awesome Guns & Range in Salt Lake City. He had passed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check"] background check and
submitted his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"] fingerprints that were sent to state and federal authorities.[6] Brown's instructor, Clark
Aposhian, described him as an "obnoxious student" and inexperienced with firearms. During a practice
shooting days before the murder, Brown accidentally fired a round into a truck, for which he later paid its
owner approximately US$1,300 (equivalent to $1,865 in 2021) in damages.[8] At this time, Brown was
living in an Ahwatukee, Arizona, hotel near an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres"] AMC movie theater.[10] He was captured on surveillance
tape having a conversation with another man in the hotel lobby. The man is considered to be a possible
accomplice or witness; however, his identity remains unknown.[5]
Robbery and murder
On November 29, 2004, Robert Keith Palomares, a 24-year-old [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_car_(valuables)"] armored car guard, was carrying the
weekend deposits outside the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres"] AMC theater at 4915 E. Ray Road in Phoenix.[4] At approximately 10 a.m.,
a hooded gunman ambushed and shot Palomares with a .45-caliber semiautomatic Glock. Five out of six
bullets fired struck Palomares in the head.[4][8] Although armed, Palomares had no time to defend
himself.[6] The gunman took a moneybag containing $56,000 in cash, ran into a nearby alley, and fled the
scene on a bicycle.[4] Palomares was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital, where he was pronounced
dead.[7] Witnesses initially described the shooter as being anywhere from 25 to 30 years old and Hispanic.
However, authorities recovered the bicycle and lifted fingerprints from it that instead linked Brown to the
 ambush murder.[2] Accordingly, he was soon considered the prime suspect in the case,[11] and an arrest
 warrant was issued on December 4 by Maricopa County Superior Court charging Brown with first degree
murder and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_robbery"] armed robbery. Brown was later also charged with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_flight_to_avoid_prosecution"] unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in a
 federal arrest warrant issued on December 6 by the United States District Court for the District of
Arizona.[12] Investigators have considered Brown's desperate financial situation as a possible motive.[8]
Fugitive
Soon after being identified as a suspect, Brown fled from Arizona to Henderson, Nevada.[4][8] He
continued on to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada"] Las Vegas where he swapped his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M3"] BMW M3 for a black [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Escalade"] Cadillac Escalade he had in
storage. He then drove to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California"] Orange County, California, where he stayed with some relatives until December
6, 2004, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation"] FBI agents carrying out an arrest warrant missed him by one hour.[8] Brown apparently used
his credit card at a gas station in southern Orange County, traveled to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego"] San Diego near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_border"] Mexican border
and then all the way to Portland, Oregon. After this, the FBI states that Brown became a "ghost" and went
completely [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-grid"] off-the-grid.

On January 16, 2005, authorities discovered his abandoned Cadillac left in a long-term parking lot at the
 Portland International Airport.[4] While in Portland, the fugitive mailed a package with clothes and golf
equipment to his older brother, David John Brown II of San Diego.[8] On April 20, 2005, David Brown
was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment"] indicted for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice"] obstruction of justice. The indictment claimed that he tampered with evidence when he
deep-cleaned his brother Jason's BMW in early December after having driven the vehicle to California
from a Las Vegas storage facility.[4][8][9] The FBI had asked him whether he knew of any storage lockers
that his younger brother had in Las Vegas; David Brown attested that he did not but prosecutors were able
to show that he did. David John Brown II pled guilty in 2007 to lying to the FBI and a federal judge in
Arizona sentenced David Brown to three years of probation.[9]
By 2005 the FBI had received over 200 leads in the case,
with the greater part of them being outside Arizona and with
dozens coming outside the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States, including possible
sightings in Canada.[4] Due to his "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_culture"] California surfer dude"
appearance and ability to blend into crowds, the FBI has
 had more leads on Brown than anyone else on its Ten Most
Wanted list, with the majority of them proving false leads.
 Reporters have noted his striking resemblance to actor Sean
Penn; one of Penn's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_double"] body doubles was once arrested by
authorities when they mistook him for Brown.[13] 
FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive Poster of
Brown.
On December 8, 2007, Brown was named by the FBI as the
 489th fugitive to be placed on its Ten Most Wanted list. The
FBI is offering a reward of up to $200,000 for information leading to his capture (the reward was doubled
on March 25, 2013).[7][14] The most recent disclosed credible sighting came in August 2008, near the
 Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City. An acquaintance of Brown, someone who had gone to missionary training
with him and accompanied him on his mission to France, recognized him when they were both stopped at a
 traffic light. Upon their mutual recognition, Brown promptly accelerated through the stoplight and sped
away. The witness shared his sighting with the authorities. According to him, Brown had a deeper tan and
had longer hair compared to the 2004 photograph on his wanted poster. Brown had previously lived in Salt
Lake City and was known to have contacts in the area. Juan Becerra, an FBI special agent in Salt Lake
City, suggested that he was in Salt Lake City to visit people whom he knew. "It's very hard for individuals
to change the way they live, the way they behave," Becerra said. "This is a guy who stays in shape, likes
fitness, likes to look good. We're hoping he's . . . been seen at a nightclub or fitness club." He stated that
Brown was comfortable outdoors, which may have been another reason for wanting to live in Salt Lake
City.[15][16]
Investigators believe that Brown may be hiding in plain sight among the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon"] Mormon community under an
 assumed identity, living with a partner who might not know his real identity, or that he has fled the country
and could be living in France, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec"] Quebec or Thailand.[9][17]
