Approach to Fiscal Year 2015
• Limit increases in the property tax levy to
less than the maximum allowed
• Sustain that reduced tax levy over multiple
fiscal years
• Avoid shifting shares of tax levy beyond the
current 60-40 split to protect taxpayers
• Hit our highest muni and school operating
budget priorities
• Prepare for major capital outlay for new
school – capital reserve fund plus excess levy
capacity

FY15 Revenue Decisions Impact Future Revenue
• Targeting all financial cost reductions in
the first year will mean higher
incremental tax increases in subsequent
years
– We should parse the savings over three years
in order to moderate tax increases over
three years
– This will create financial flexibility and
create revenue capacity to accommodate the
Schools building projects
