Commonwealth of Massachusetts to amend these Regulations periodically from time to time as it sees fit. 
For the purposes hereof, the Regulations, Ordinances, and Chapter 138 shall be collectively referred to as
the “Laws”.
Any license issued for the sale in any manner of any alcoholic beverages (a “License”) shall be
issued on the condition of full compliance with these Regulations. The failure to comply with the Laws and
other Ordinances or rules issued by the City and/or the Board shall constitute sufficient cause or grounds for
refusing to grant the license, or for suspending, canceling, modifying, or revoking such license or permit
already granted, in accordance with Article XIV herein. Any individual, organization, or company licensed
by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to herein as a “Licensee”.
Any premises licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to as the “Licensed
Premises”.
I.  Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages
Public consumption of alcoholic beverages as defined in Chapter 138, Section 1 is permitted only in
accordance with an appropriate License issued by the Board. Absent an appropriate License issued by the
Board, it is prohibited to drink any alcoholic beverage while on, in or upon any public way or upon any way
to which the public has a right of access; any place to which members of the public have access as invitees
or licensees; a park or playground. It is prohibited to drink any alcoholic beverage while on, in or upon or
private land or place without consent of the owner or person in control thereof. All alcoholic beverages used

before the proposed effective date of the change (“Change of Management Notice Deadline”), unless the
Manager of Record has terminated his or her employment without prior notice to the Licensee or is

Management Deadline Notice (“Early Management Termination”). In the event of Early Management
Termination, the Licensee must, within thirty (30) days of such termination, notify the Board of: (a) the

Page 5 of 21
Page 6
(iii) shall file the application for a Change of Manager no more than thirty (30) days after the departure of
the approved Manager of Record. If the Board finds that the circumstances justify the noncompliance with
the Change of Manager Notice Timeline, no penalty will be imposed so long as the Licensee complies with
subsections (i) through (iii) above. If the circumstances for the delay are not found to be sufficient, or if the
application for a Change of Manager is filed more than thirty (30) days after the departure of the Manager of
Record, the Board may impose a penalty or suspension of up to one (1) day of suspension for each day of 
unjustified non-compliance or for each day that passes beyond the passage of thirty (30) days after departure
of the Manager of Record before the application for a new manager is filed, or such other penalty permitted
by Article XIV herein. In addition to the foregoing, the Board shall also have the right to impose penalties
for the failure to provide timely notification of the departure of an Assistant Manager. When submitting an
application for change of Manager or Assistant Manager, the Manager or Assistant Manager shall be certified
as an alcohol server and registered with the Police Department prior to submitting the application. Further, 
approval of a change in Manager may be conditioned upon proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, 
and federal taxes and fees.

the case of a new Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, upon being advised of the new Manager of
Record or Assistant Manager’s identity, the Framingham Police Department will conduct a background
check of any proposed Licensee, Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, and such check will include a
review of any existing criminal record. The Board may reject any application where the Licensee’s, 
Manager of Record’s or Assistant Manager’s criminal record indicates, theft, unlawful drug offense(s) (with
the exception of any criminal arrest or conviction relating to possession of marijuana which predate the
enactment of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 94G), alcohol-related offenses, a propensity for violence,
or other behavior, that, in the opinion of the Board, might disqualify the individual from responsibly
carrying out their duties as Manager of Record or would otherwise put the public at risk.
3.  Violations. A violation of any of subsection 1 regarding change of Manager shall 
constitute a violation of these Regulations and shall subject the Licensee to possible discipline and/or
penalties in accordance with this section or with Article XIV herein.
V.  Responsibilities of Manager of Record:
1.  Authority & Control of Licensed Premises. The Board regards the Manager of Record of
Licensed Premises as the principal representative of the Licensee and as having full authority and control of
the Licensed Premises and of the conduct of all business therein relative to alcoholic beverages, all as
provided in the Laws. An Assistant Manager or other suitable managerial employee capable of fulfilling the
duties of Manager of Record must be listed on the License by the Licensee. This will allow for continuity of
the Manager position should either the Manager of Record or Assistant Manager positions become vacant
during the course of the year.
2.  Responsibilities. Without limiting the scope of the previous subsection, the Board will hold
the Manager of Record responsible for the following:
a. Careful selection of qualified employees of the licensed business, including servers,

Page 7
b. Training of employees in all matters relating to the sale and service of alcoholic
beverages;
c. Assuring that employees serving alcohol to the public have successfully completed an
alcoholic beverage training program for serving alcohol responsibly and strongly
encourage continual training of employees engaged in serving and selling alcoholic
beverages;
d. Ensuring that no criminal activity, including the sale and distribution of narcotic
drugs, takes place on the Licensed Premises, including within any parking area 
ancillary to or serving the Licensed Premises;
e. Promptly reporting to the Police Department all instances of attempted purchases or
procurement of service of alcoholic beverages by minors, including attempts to gain
access to premises upon which alcoholic beverages are served and from which minors
are excluded, and appropriate action taken by the Licensee in response thereto. Such
appropriate action shall include (1) Reporting to the Registry of Motor Vehicles
instances involving possession or use of a false, forged, or counterfeit license to operate
motor vehicles or identification card issued by the Registry of Motor Vehicles; (2) 
confiscation of liquor identification cards or motor vehicle operator’s license presented
by the minor; and (3) if a purchase was made or service was procured, the name of the 
Licensee’s employee participating therein;
f. Enforcement of the Laws with respect to the operation of the licensed business;
g. Ensuring that the Licensed Premises, including the exterior, are kept clean, neat, and
sanitary at all times; and
h. The Board strongly encourages the Manager of Record and/or Assistant Manager to
attend the recommended Annual Alcohol Education Seminar. Failure to attend such
seminar shall not constitute a defense to any violation of the Laws.
3.  Hours on Licensed Premises. Except as provided herein, the Manager of Record must be
a full-time employee or a corporate officer of the Licensee, must be engaged exclusively in the
management of the licensed business, and must be a qualified seller or server of alcoholic beverages
registered with the Framingham Police Department. The Manager of Record shall not undertake any non-
managerial position(s) (i.e., bartender, server, cook) or any other role which interferes with the Manager of
Record’s oversight of the Licensed Premises. The Manager of Record must be on the Licensed Premises at
least forty (40) hours per week in the course of business, consistent with the permitted hours of operation.
When the Manager of Record is not upon the Licensed Premises, the person in charge of the business must
be an Assistant Manager or a qualified seller or server of alcoholic beverages registered with the
Framingham Police Department and designated by the approved Manager of Record to have charge of the
business in the Manager’s absence. The Manager of Record shall be responsible for the operation of the
business whether or not on the Licensed Premises. When the Manager of Record is not upon the Licensed
Premises, a method 
Page 7 of 21
Page 8
of contacting the Manager of Record promptly must be arranged so that the Manager of Record can be
reached at all times by the person designated to be in charge of the Licensed Premises. The provisions of
the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to any Licensee holding a license issued under Chapter
138, Section 12 to a veterans’ organization or to a Licensee holding a license issued to a club under
Chapter 138, Section 17.
4.  Failure of the Manager of Record to comply with this policy or to properly discharge the
duties of manager may result in removal as Manager or suspension or revocation of the License as may be
appropriate to the circumstances.
VI. Procedure for Obtaining Liquor Licenses
The applicant for a License of any type should submit a letter to the Board outlining the proposal
with a completed application and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant should
request to be placed on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the hearing in
accordance with Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the application for a
License and the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then consider the application
and respond in a timely manner to the applicant. The Board shall provide a copy of these Regulations to
each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The Licensee shall sign a receipt to be
maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these Regulations.
Pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 15A, where there are no premises actually in existence at the time
the application for a License is made, the applicant shall file a plan showing the actual dimensions of
premises which are to be constructed on which the License is to be exercised. A License granted under this
provision shall be upon the condition that such License shall not be issued until completion of the Licensed
Premises in accordance with the plan, and the decision of the Board as to whether the plan has been
complied with shall be final. The Board may include as a condition of such License that the Licensed
Premises be completed in accordance with the plan by a date certain or the License shall be deemed null and
void. Said specified completion date may be extended by the Board in its sole discretion upon written
request by the applicant submitted to the Board at least 45 days prior to the expiration of the initial
anticipated completion date as stated in the License.
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer:
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
particular License application:
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license.
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that offers
a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work.
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application.
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location.
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the City
of Framingham. 
Page 8 of 21
Page 9
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 12, the
applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic beverages (or
beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft sodas, teas, 
kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional non-alcoholic
beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or high-
density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the applicant’s
proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises presently located
in the area.
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without the
prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall be
considered a change in location or number of seats, location of bar, addition or reduction in square footage,
or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham.
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany each
application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location shall be
processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant such transfer
requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon the proof of
payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the following: receipts
showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and withheld federal and state
income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court- appointed receivers, or to assignees 
for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession of the Licensed Premises by, through or
under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights to the license or the renewal or transfer of
such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in
the application as holding such interest shall be treated in the same manner as the original majority
ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for any transfers of ownership or location, including, 
but not limited to transfers to mortgagees.
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance of
their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing Department and
online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These Regulations shall be
appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick up his/her annual license
until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these Regulations has been received. A
copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the Licensed Premises at all times and shall be
available for inspection upon request.

by a government of a foreign country recognized by the United States government, or a

A.  Purpose
The purpose of this penalty structure is to improve the ability of the Board to prevent alcohol abuse
and violation of the Laws. This Article XIV will help to achieve reasonable uniformity in the imposition of
penalties and to avoid confusion in the minds of the public, patrons, and Licensees due to a lack of
understanding of the consequences of violating the Laws and License terms. This Article XIV is intended to
empower the Board to consider the circumstances of each case and provide a mechanism by which
Licensees can improve their compliance with the Laws in the future.
B.  General Provisions
1. No Illegality on Premises. No Licensee shall permit any illegality to occur on the Licensed
Premises, regardless of whether such illegality relates to the sale and service of alcoholic
beverages. The Manager of Record shall at all times maintain order and decorum on the
premises and in the immediately surrounding area of the premises and shall cooperate with
City officials in ensuring safe and orderly facilities.
2. Reporting of Incidents. All violations of the Laws are to be reported to the Framingham

that becomes aware of an offense involving the Licensed Premises within twenty-four hours of
said violation unless the incident is serious enough to comprise public safety and needs
immediate attention at which time Framingham Police shall be notified forthwith. Failure to
report a violation involving the Licensed Premises constitutes a violation of these Regulations
and will subject the Licensee to appropriate discipline in accordance with the procedure set
forth herein.
3. Penalties; Generally. Penalties for offenses shall be in line with the City’s general goals of
protecting public safety and the general welfare. Penalties will also be imposed with the goal of
preventing future offenses. A violation of these Regulations alone (rather than state law or the
Ordinances) may give rise to the issuance of penalties pursuant to this Article to the extent
permitted under law. The nature and severity of the penalties imposed will be decided
according to the nature of the offense and the presence of mitigating or aggravating
circumstances as further described herein. All offenses by Licensees will result in the
imposition of a penalty of some degree. This will impress upon Licensees, managers, and
servers their responsibility for ensuring compliance with these Regulations, for prevention of
offenses and for compliance with the terms of licenses and the liquor laws of the
Commonwealth.

Participation in Alcohol Abuse and Offense Prevention Programs; and/or (g) any
other reasonable penalty, in the Board’s reasonable discretion.

to provide indication of the range of penalties the Board will impose if a hearing is
held on any offense. The Board will refer to these guidelines by deciding whether to
approve a negotiated recommended resolution.

Department is authorized to negotiate with any authorized representative of the Licensee the
terms upon which the Police Department will recommend to the Board that an offense be
resolved.

Board.

Laws. The notice provided to Licensee may contain the Police Department's recommendation to
the Board concerning the punishment for the alleged violation. The notice will include the date of
the event giving rise to the possible disciplinary action, a description of the event, and a clear
identification of the Laws that are alleged to have been violated as a result of the event. Said

concerning the Licensee's  alleged violation. A notice containing the above-mentioned
information shall be sent to Licensee via certified mail return receipt requested no less than ten
(10) days prior to the date of the hearing before the Board. Licensees are entitled to retain

the Licensee for a violation of the Laws, the Board will provide the Licensee with a statement of
reasons why disciplinary action was taken against Licensee. The above-mentioned statement of
reasons will be included with the notice of the Board’s disciplinary action.
