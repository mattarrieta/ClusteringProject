Property Tax Implications
• Keep residential tax increase moderate
($100 or under for the average home)
• Keep tax burden stable at 60% residential
and 40% CIP with no swings toward one
sector or the other
• Reserve funds to moderate the increase
and/or the share of tax burden
• This is planned for the next three budget
cycles (fiscal years)

State Aid Assumptions FY15 +
• Ch 70 up 7% to $34 million (+$2.2 million)

Current Free Cash Policy

fiscal year from the year certified, e.g. 
FY13 is used in the FY15 budget
• Allocations: 
• Up to $1.5 million for Operating budget
• 40% of net to Stabilization Fund
• 20% of net allocated for Capital budget
use
• 40% remains in Fund balance

Free Cash Usage
• Bond rating agencies have cited our use of free
cash in the operating budget as a weakness
• In FY14 we began a plan reported in the FY13 Long
Range Forecast to wean ourselves off free cash in
$200,000 increments
• FY14 used $1.3M; FY15 planned $1.1M; FY16
planned $900K; FY17 planned $700K; etc until $0
used in FY21
• We also implemented a 15% allocation to OPEB; 
reducing the Stabilization Fund from 40% to 25% 
since the Stabilization fund reached its 5% budget
goal
