Re:  Repurchase of Assigned Partnership Interests
Mrs. W. H. Keenan established a fund at the Foundation in October 1997 with an
initial contribution of $10,000 and a subsequent contribution of a 1.2176% interest
in the Keenan Ltd. (the “Partnership”) valued at $ 150,982. Arthur Anderson
produced the appraisal of the Partnership. The composition of the assets of the
Partnership at the time of the contribution were as follows:
Stocks, bonds and cash
Real estate and minerals 
96%
4%
We have been notified by the general partner that the Partnership wishes to exercise
the call provision in the Partnership agreement to repurchase the Foundation’s
1.2176% interest in the Partnership based on an Arthur Anderson updated
appraisal as of May 3, 2001. The updated appraisal values the Foundation’s interest
to be $187,636. The updated composition of the Partnership’s assets is:
Stocks, bonds and cash
Real estate, notes receivable and other assets 
88%
12%
The Foundation engaged Ferguson Campbell Poll P.C. to review Arthur Anderson’s
updated appraisal and they found the methodologies, assumptions and conclusions
in the appraisal to be reasonable.
Please indicate below your approval or disapproval of selling the Foundation’s
1.2176% interest to the Partnership for $187,636 and return this form to me by fax
or mail.
