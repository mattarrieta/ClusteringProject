EMPLOYEE OPT OUT FORM
OregonSaves is a completely voluntary program. You can opt out at any time online, by phone, or by completing this form. If you do not opt
out your employer will send payroll contributions to your OregonSaves account. Amounts you save in this account are always your money. Your
account is in your control and goes with you from job to job in accordance with the OregonSaves Program terms. Every little bit you save now
can potentially make a difference in retirement. To opt out of payroll contributions to OregonSaves for more than one employer you must
submit a separate form for each employer.
Completed forms should be mailed
back to OregonSaves.
