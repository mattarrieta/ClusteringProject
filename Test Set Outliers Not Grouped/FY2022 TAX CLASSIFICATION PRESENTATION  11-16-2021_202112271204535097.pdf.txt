Value Trends/Comments
Residential
o Single family – parcel increase (+11) and value increase
o Condominiums – parcel increase (+75) and value increase….Millwood Preserve Condominium as an example
o Apartment complexes - additional value will be added as these projects continue to develop (Bancroft Lofts)
Commercial & Industrial
o Neutral value change in the commercial class, and increase for industrial properties. Office and retail vacancies
are still an issue to consider and monitor. 
Personal Property Two Areas (State Valued and Locally Valued):
o First area is state valued business assets in Framingham, 14 accounts, 16.0% + or - of total personal property
value. Landline Telephone Accounts such as Verizon New England and AT&T and Tennessee Gas Pipeline

New Growth
New growth is essentially the value increase from new
construction and the value increase from real or personal
property items not previously assessed. This value increase is
then converted to a tax amount as part of the Proposition 2.5% 
calculation. 
New Growth Valuation is 155,013,392 which translates to tax
levy growth of $3,566,275 for Fiscal Year 2022.

Converting Value to Tax
 Tax Rate Setting Process 
▪ Work throughout the fiscal year to adjust and refine personal and real property
values.
▪ Submit and receive approvals from the Division of Local Services of the
Department of Revenue on total City wide value and new growth.
▪ Complete the Tax Recap and various other required reports through Gateway
with the Chief Financial Officer, the City Accountant and the City Tax Collector.
▪ Hold published Classification Hearing so that the City Council can select the tax
burden for the taxpayers.
▪ Submit the City Council choices to the Bureau of Accounts of the Department of
Revenue for tax rate approval.

Development of Tax Rate
STEP 1:
Establish Property Values
• Residential/Open Space
• Commercial/Industrial/Personal Property
TOTAL TAXABLE VALUE 
9,312,610,088 (78.93%)
2,486,410,277 (21.07%)
11,799,020,365
(Exempt real property value is 1,323,888,294)

Page 12
Development of Tax Rate
STEP 2:
Determine Single Tax Rate for All Property Classes
▪ Residential/Open Space  9,312,610,088
▪ Commercial/Industrial/Personal Property  2,486,410,277
▪ TOTAL TAXABLE VALUE  11,799,020,365
Tax Levy divided by Total Taxable Value
$200,114,185/11,799,020,365 = 0.01696
OR
$16.96/1000 value
For the Average Single Family Value of 490,900 the Real Estate Tax Bill Would be $8,325.66
at a Single Tax Rate Choice. 
12
Page 13
Development of Tax Rate
STEP 3:
Determine Split Tax Rate for Property Classes
▪ A residential factor of less than 1, reduces the share of the tax levy paid by the Residential and
Open Space classes and increases the share of the tax levy paid by the Commercial and
Industrial classes and by Personal Property businesses.
▪ Commercial/Industrial/Personal Property taxpayers cannot pay more than 150% of full and fair
cash value; Residential/Open Space must pay at least 65% of FFCV.
▪ However, with Chapter 200, parameters can be expanded so that CIP taxpayers pay a maximum
of 175%, and RO taxpayers pay the greater of 50% of FFCV or lowest percentage share of the
levy they have paid since classification began. 
▪ Framingham meets this threshold, therefore the 175% shift is available.

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY VALUES – FISCAL YEAR 2022
• Industrial vacancy remains almost non-existent in both
Framingham and the MetroWest region
• Office vacancy rates in both Framingham and the Metro West
region are still a concern and something that we will continue to
monitor…As an example the vacancy rate in the Framingham-
Natick Area is 11% ± compared to 21.5% ± in the 495 West Area
(Hudson, Marlborough, Southborough) compared to 3.6% in the
495 South Area (Bellingham, Franklin, Shrewsbury)
• Retail and Restaurant vacancies climbed in 2020, with both some
retail space and some restaurants that are either empty or that
have left the area or closed their business 
28
Page 29
Property Values – Looking Ahead to Fiscal Year 2023
• Apartment values will continue to trend higher, rents
will likely increase and most concessions will disappear
• Industrial Values will trend higher as available space
remains almost non-existent due to continued strong
demand for laboratory, research and development, and
warehouse space
• Commercial values will be somewhat mixed and
nominal declines might continue in the office, retail, 
and restaurant sectors
• These projections are based upon a current survey of
the Framingham real estate market as well as regional
and national sources

STEP 6 (continued):
Choose Residential Factor/CIP Shift
To determine tax share burden for property classes
▪Single or Multiple Tax Rates
Municipalities must decide whether or not to reduce the share of the tax levy paid by the
residential and open space property owners and shift that tax burden to commercial, 
industrial, and personal property taxpayers.
Choosing to allocate the tax burden, the City Council must vote the residential factor
which results in a percentage shift and decreases the Residential Rate and increases the
CIP Rate. 
30
Page 31
ANNUAL OPTIONS (1 of 3)
▪Open Space Discount
Class 2 property is property which is not otherwise classified and which is not taxable under the
provisions of Chapter 61, 61A, or 61B, or taxable under a permanent conservation restriction, and
which land is not held for the production of income but is maintained in an open or natural
condition and which contributes significantly to the benefit and enjoyment of the public.
The Open Space Discount allows for designated land to receive up to 25% reduction or 75% of the residential factor. This
discount increases the Residential Tax Rate.
THIS OPTION HAS LESS BENEFIT THAN THE CHAPTER LAND DESIGNATION AND IT IS NOT USUALLY
ENACTED BY COMMUNITIES – THERE ARE NO PROPERTIES IN FRAMINGHAM IN THE OPEN SPACE CLASS
The Open Space Discount has been adopted in only the community of Bedford 
31
Page 32
ANNUAL OPTIONS (2 of 3)
▪Residential Exemption
Adopting the residential exemption increases the residential tax rate. The amount of the tax
levy paid by the Class remains the same, but because of the exempted valuation, it is
distributed over less assessed value. This higher rate creates a shift within the class that
reduces the taxes paid by homeowners with moderately valued properties. Those taxes are
paid by owners of rental properties, vacation homes and higher valued homes.
The Residential Exemption has been adopted in the following 15 communities: Barnstable, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, 
Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Nantucket, Provincetown, Somerville, Tisbury, Truro, Waltham, Watertown, Wellfleet 
32
Page 33
ANNUAL OPTIONS (3 of 3)
▪Small Commercial Exemption
The Small Commercial Exemption grants an exemption amount up to 10% of Class Three, 
Commercial properties that are occupied by businesses with an average annual employment of no
more than 10 people and an assessed valuation of less than 1,000,000.
TAX RATE IMPACT: Adopting a Small Commercial exemption increases the commercial and
industrial tax rates. The amount of the tax levy paid by those two classes remains the same, but
because of the exempted valuation, it is distributed over less assessed value. This higher rate
creates a shift that reduces the taxes paid by owners of properties occupied by small businesses
and shifts them to larger commercial and industrial taxpayers.
The Small Commercial Exemption has been adopted in the following 14 communities: Auburn, Avon, Bellingham, Berlin, Braintree, Chelmsford, 
Dartmouth, Erving, New Ashford, North Attleborough, Seekonk, Swampscott, Westford, Wrentham
