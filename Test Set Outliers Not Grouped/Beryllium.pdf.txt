Beryllium
Beryllium is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"] chemical element with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(chemistry)"] symbol
Be and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"] atomic number 4. It is a steel-gray, strong,
lightweight and brittle [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"] alkaline earth metal. It is a
 divalent element that occurs naturally only in
combination with other elements to form
minerals. Notable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstones"] gemstones high in beryllium
include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl"] beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and
chrysoberyl. It is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Universe"] relatively rare element in the
universe, usually occurring as a product of the
 spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have
collided with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray"] cosmic rays. Within the cores of
stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into
heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about
0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust. The
world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons
is usually manufactured by extraction from the
mineral beryl, a  difficult process because
beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.
In structural applications, the combination of high
 flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal
conductivity and low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"] density (1.85 times that of
water) make beryllium metal a  desirable
 aerospace material for aircraft components,
missiles, spacecraft, and satellites.[6] Because of
its low density and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass"] atomic mass, beryllium is
relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of
 ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most
common window material for X-ray equipment
and components of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_detector"] particle detectors.[6] When
added as an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloying element to aluminium,
 copper (notably the alloy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_copper"] beryllium copper), iron,
or nickel, beryllium improves many physical
properties.[6] For example, tools and components
made of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_copper"] beryllium copper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloys are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_materials"] strong and
 hard and do not create sparks when they strike a
steel surface. In air, the surface of beryllium
oxidizes readily at room temperature to form a
 passivation layer 1–10 nm thick that protects it
from further oxidation and corrosion. The metal
oxidizes in bulk (beyond the passivation layer)
when heated above 500 °C (932 °F), and burns
brilliantly when heated to about 2,500 °C
(4,530 °F).

of appropriate dust control equipment and
industrial controls at all times because of the
 toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that
can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic

Beryllium is a steel gray and hard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"] metal that is
brittle at room temperature and has a close-
packed hexagonal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure"] crystal structure.[6] It has
exceptional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"] stiffness ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus"] Young's modulus 287 GPa)
 and a melting point of 1287 °C. The modulus of
elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50%
greater than that of steel. The combination of this
modulus and a relatively low density results in an
unusually fast [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound"] sound conduction speed in
 beryllium – about 12.9 km/s  at ambient
conditions. Other significant properties are high
specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1)  and thermal
conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1),  which make
beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation
characteristics per unit weight. In combination
with the relatively low coefficient of linear
 thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1),  these
characteristics result in a unique stability under
conditions of thermal loading.[8]

 is isotopically pure beryllium-9, which has a nuclear spin of 3
2
. Beryllium has a large scattering cross
section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_(unit)"] barns for energies above approximately 10 keV. Therefore, it
works as a neutron reflector and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator"] neutron moderator, effectively slowing the neutrons to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_temperature"] thermal energy
range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower; the exact
value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.
The single primordial beryllium isotope 9Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies
over about 1.9 MeV, to produce 8Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for
high-energy neutrons, beryllium is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_multiplier"] neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This
nuclear reaction is:[9]
94Be + n → 2 42He + 2 n
Neutrons are liberated when beryllium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus"] nuclei are struck by energetic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"] alpha particles[8] producing the
nuclear reaction
94Be + 42He → 126C + n
where 42He is an alpha particle and 126C is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-12"] carbon-12 nucleus.[9]Beryllium also releases neutrons under
bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a
suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reaction"] nuclear reaction [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_source"] neutron sources for
the laboratory production of free neutrons.
Small amounts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium"] tritium are liberated when 94Be nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three-step

Optical properties
As a metal, beryllium is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"] transparent or translucent to most wavelengths of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"] X-rays and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"] gamma rays, making
it useful for the output windows of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_tube"] X-ray tubes and other such apparatus.[11]
Isotopes and nucleosynthesis
Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It
is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium
when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays"] cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.[12] Primordial
beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoisotopic_element"] monoisotopic and
 mononuclidic element. 
Radioactive cosmogenic 10[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium-10"] Be is produced in the
 atmosphere of the Earth by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_spallation"] cosmic ray spallation of
oxygen.[13] 10Be accumulates at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"] soil surface,
where its relatively long [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"] half-life (1.36 million years)
permits a long [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_time_(fluid_dynamics)"] residence time before decaying to
boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are
used to examine natural [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_erosion"] soil erosion, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_formation"] soil formation
and the development of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laterite"] lateritic soils, and as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(climate)"] proxy
for measurement of the variations in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation"] solar activity and
the age of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core"] ice cores.[14] The production of 10Be is
Plot showing variations in solar activity, including
variation in sunspot number (red) and 10Be
concentration (blue). Note that the beryllium scale
is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate
lower 10Be levels 
inversely proportional to solar activity, because
increased [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind during periods of high solar
activity decreases the flux of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_cosmic_ray"] galactic cosmic rays that
reach the Earth.[13] Nuclear explosions also form 10Be
by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon
dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past
activity at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_test"] nuclear weapon test sites.[15]The isotope
7Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much
like 10Be.
8Be has a very short half-life of about 8×10−17 s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as
elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang"] Big Bang.[16] This
is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis"] nucleosynthesis phase to produce carbon by the
 fusion of 4He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available beryllium-8. British astronomer Sir Fred
 Hoyle first showed that the energy levels of 8Be and 12C allow carbon production by the so-called triple-
alpha process in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows
carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life"] carbon-based life)
 is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by AGB stars and supernovae (see also Big
Bang nucleosynthesis), as well as the creation of all other elements with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"] atomic numbers larger than that of
carbon.[17]
Page 5
The 2s electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when 7Be decays by L-
 electron capture, it does so by taking electrons from its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital"] atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding.
This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings – a rare
occurrence in nuclear decay.[18]
The shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is 16Be, which decays through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_emission"] neutron emission with a half-
life of 6.5 ×10−22 s.[19] The exotic isotopes 11Be and 14Be are known to exhibit a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_nucleus"] nuclear halo.[20] This
phenomenon can be understood as the nuclei of 11Be and 14Be have, respectively, 1 and 4 neutrons
orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi 'waterdrop' model of the nucleus.
Occurrence 
 The Sun has a concentration of 0.1 parts
per billion (ppb) of beryllium.[21] Beryllium
 has a concentration of 2 to 6 parts per
million (ppm) in the Earth's crust.[22] It is
most concentrated in the soils, 6 ppm.[23]
Trace amounts of 9Be are found in the
Earth's atmosphere.[23] The concentration
 of beryllium in sea water is 0.2–0.6 parts

per trillion.[23][24] In stream water,
however, beryllium is more abundant with
a concentration of 0.1 ppb.[25] 
 Emerald is a

Beryllium is found in over 100 minerals,[26] but most are uncommon to rare. The
more common beryllium containing minerals include: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrandite"] bertrandite 
 compound of
beryllium.
(Be4Si2O7(OH)2), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl"] beryl (Al2Be3Si6O18), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysoberyl"] chrysoberyl (Al2BeO4) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenakite"] phenakite
(Be2SiO4). Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_beryl"] red beryl and emerald.[8][27][28] The green color in
gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium (about 2% for emerald).[29]
The two main ores of beryllium, beryl and bertrandite, are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, Madagascar,
Russia and the United States.[29] Total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400,000 tonnes.[29]
Production
The extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at
elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. Currently the United
States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale extraction of
 beryllium.[30] Kazakhstan produces beryllium from a concentrate stockpiled before the breakup of the
Soviet Union around 1991. This resource has become nearly depleted by mid-2010s.[31]
Production of beryllium in Russia was halted in 1997, and is planned to be resumed in the 2020s.[32][33]
Beryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral beryl, which is either [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering"] sintered using an extraction
 agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with sodium
 fluorosilicate and soda at 770 °C (1,420 °F) to form sodium fluoroberyllate, aluminium oxide and silicon
 dioxide.[6] Beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium
hydroxide in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder
and heating it to 1,650 °C (3,000 °F).[6] The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated 250 to
Page 6
 300 °C (482 to 572 °F) in concentrated sulfuric acid, mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium
sulfate.[6] Aqueous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"] ammonia is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium
hydroxide.
Beryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_fluoride"] beryllium fluoride
or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_chloride"] beryllium chloride. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium
hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to 1,000 °C (1,830 °F)
to form beryllium fluoride.[6] Heating the fluoride to 900 °C (1,650 °F) with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"] magnesium forms finely
divided beryllium, and additional heating to 1,300 °C (2,370 °F) creates the compact metal.[6] Heating
beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide, which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and
chlorine. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis"] Electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.[6]
Chemical properties
A beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s2. The predominant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_state"] oxidation state of beryllium is
+2; the beryllium atom has lost both of its valence electrons. Lower oxidation states have been found in, for
example, bis(carbene) compounds.[34] Beryllium's chemical behavior is largely a result of its small [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radius"] atomic
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_radius"] ionic radii. It thus has very high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_potential"] ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other
atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. Its chemistry has similarities with the chemistry of
aluminium, an example of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_relationship"] diagonal relationship.
At room temperature, the surface of beryllium forms a 1−10 nm-thick oxide [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_(chemistry)"] passivation layer that prevents
further reactions with air, except for gradual thickening of the oxide up to about 25 nm. When heated above
about 500 °C, oxidation into the bulk metal progresses along grain boundaries.[35] Once the metal is ignited
in air by heating above the oxide melting point around 2500 °C, beryllium burns brilliantly, forming a
mixture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_oxide"] beryllium oxide and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_nitride"] beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_acid"] oxidizing acids, such
as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"] nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to
that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.[6][36]
Binary compounds of beryllium(II) are polymeric in the solid state. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_fluoride"] BeF2 has a silica-like structure with
corner-shared BeF4 tetrahedra. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_chloride"] BeCl2 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_bromide"] BeBr2 have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra.
 Beryllium oxide, BeO, is a white [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"] refractory solid, which has the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_sulfide"] wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal
conductivity as high as some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Beryllium sulfide, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenide"] selenide and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluride_(chemistry)"] telluride are
known, all having the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system#Zincblende_structure"] zincblende structure.[37] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_nitride"] Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a high-melting-point compound
which is readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN6 is known and beryllium phosphide, Be3P2 has a
similar structure to Be3N2. A number of beryllium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boride"] borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2,
BeB6 and BeB12. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_carbide"] Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to
give methane.[37] No beryllium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicide"] silicide has been identified.[36]
The halides BeX2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.[36]
Complexes of the halides are formed with one or more ligands donating at total of two pairs of electrons.
Such compounds obey the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_rule"] octet rule. Other 4-coordinate complexes such as the aqua-ion [Be(H2O)4]2+
also obey the octet rule.
Aqueous solutions
The aqueous solution chemistry of beryllium is the subject of a comprehensive review.[38] Solutions of
beryllium salts, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_sulfate"] beryllium sulfate and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_nitrate"] beryllium nitrate, are acidic because of hydrolysis of the
[Be(H2O)4]2+ ion. The concentration of the first hydrolysis product, [Be(H2O)3(OH)]+, is less than 1% of
Page 7
Beryllium hydrolysis. Water
molecules attached to Be are
omitted in this diagram 
the beryllium concentration. The most
stable hydrolysis product is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimer_(chemistry)"] trimeric
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_hydroxide"] ion [Be3(OH)3(H2O)6]3+.  Beryllium
hydroxide, Be(OH)2, is insoluble in water
at pH 5 or more. Consequently, beryllium
compounds are generally insoluble at
biological pH. Because of this, inhalation
of beryllium metal dust by people leads to
the development of the fatal condition of
berylliosis. Be(OH)2 dissolves in strongly
 alkaline solutions. 
Schematic structure of
basic beryllium acetate
Beryllium(II) forms few complexes with monodentate ligands because
the water molecules in the aquo-ion,  are bound very
strongly to the beryllium ion. Notable exceptions are
the series of water-soluble complexes with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"] fluoride
ion.[39]
Structure of the trimeric hydrolysis product of
beryllium(II)
Beryllium(II) forms many complexes with bidentate ligands containing oxygen-donor atoms.[38] The
 species  is notable for having a 3-coordinate oxide ion at its center. Basic beryllium
acetate,  , has an oxide ion surrounded by a tetrahedron of beryllium atoms.
With organic ligands, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malonic_acid"] malonate ion, the acid is de-protonated when forming the complex. The
donor atoms are two oxygens.
Formation of a complex is in competition with the metal ion-hydrolysis reaction and mixed complexes with
both the anion and the hydroxide ion are also formed. For example, derivatives of the cyclic trimer are
known, with a bidentate ligand replacing one or more pairs of water molecules. Ligands such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDTA"] EDTA
behave as dicarboxylic acids.
Page 8
Hydroxycarboxylic acids such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycollic_acid"] glycollic acid form rather weak, monodentate, complexes in solution in
which the hydroxyl group remains intact. A hexamer,  , in which the hydroxyl
groups are deprotonated was isolated, in the solid state, long ago.[40] Aromatic di-hydroxy ligands form
relatively strong complexes. For example, log K1 and log K2 values of 12.2 and 9.3 have been reported for
complexes with tiron.[41]
There are many early reports of complexes with amino acids, but unfortunately they are not reliable as the
concomitant hydrolysis reactions were not understood at the time of publication. Values for log β of ca. 6 to
7 have been reported.[42] The degree of formation is small because of competition with hydrolysis
reactions.
Organic chemistry
Organoberyllium chemistry is limited to academic research due to the cost and toxicity of beryllium,
beryllium derivatives and reagents required for the introduction of beryllium, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_chloride"] beryllium chloride.
Organometallic beryllium compounds are known to be highly reactive[43] Examples of known
organoberyllium compounds are dineopentylberyllium,[44] beryllocene (Cp2Be),[45][46][47][48]
diallylberyllium (by exchange reaction of diethyl beryllium with triallyl boron),[49] bis(1,3-
trimethylsilylallyl)beryllium[50] and Be(mes)2.[43] Ligands can also be aryls[51] and alkynyls.[52]
History
The mineral beryl, which contains beryllium, has been used at least since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty"] Ptolemaic dynasty of
 Egypt.[53] In the first century CE, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder mentioned in his encyclopedia Natural
History that beryl and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald"] emerald ("smaragdus") were similar.[54] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Graecus_Holmiensis"] Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis, written in
the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.[54]
Early analyses of emeralds and beryls by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heinrich_Klaproth"] Martin Heinrich Klaproth,
 Torbern Olof Bergman, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Karl_Achard"] Franz Karl Achard, and Johann Jakob Bindheim
always yielded similar elements, leading to the fallacious conclusion that
both substances are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_silicate"] aluminium silicates.[55] Mineralogist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Just_Ha%C3%BCy"] René Just Haüy
discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked
chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Nicolas_Vauquelin"] Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin for a chemical analysis.[53]
In a 1798 paper read before the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_de_France"] Institut de France, Vauquelin reported that
he found a new "earth" by dissolving [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_hydroxide"] aluminium hydroxide from emerald
and beryl in an additional alkali.[56] The editors of the journal Annales de
Chimie et de Physique named the new earth "glucine" for the sweet taste of
some of its compounds.[57] Klaproth preferred the name "beryllina" due to
the fact that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttria"] yttria also formed sweet salts.[58][59] The name "beryllium"
was first used by Wöhler in 1828.[60] 
 Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin
discovered beryllium
 Friedrich Wöhler[61] and Antoine Bussy[62] independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the chemical
reaction of metallic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"] potassium with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_chloride"] beryllium chloride, as follows:
BeCl2 + 2 K → 2 KCl + Be
Using an alcohol lamp, Wöhler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-
shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white
hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles
Page 9
with a dark metallic luster.[63] The highly reactive potassium had been
produced by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis"] electrolysis of its compounds, a process discovered 21
years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small
grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or
hammered.
 Friedrich Wöhler was one of
the men who independently
isolated beryllium 
 The direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium
fluoride by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lebeau"] Paul Lebeau in 1898 resulted in the first pure (99.5 to 99.8%)
samples of beryllium.[63] However, industrial production started only after
the First World War. The original industrial involvement included
subsidiaries and scientists related to the Union Carbide and Carbon
Corporation in Cleveland OH and Siemens & Halske AG in Berlin. In the
US, the process was ruled by Hugh S. Cooper, director of The Kemet
Laboratories Company. In Germany, the first commercially successful
process for producing beryllium was developed in 1921 by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Stock"] Alfred Stock
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Goldschmidt"] Hans Goldschmidt.[64]
A sample of beryllium was bombarded with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_ray"] alpha rays from the decay of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium"] radium in a 1932 experiment by
 James Chadwick that uncovered the existence of the neutron.[29] This same method is used in one class of
radioisotope-based laboratory [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_source"] neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.[22]
Beryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II, due to the rising demand for hard
 beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc
orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium
 tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based
phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.[65]
Electrolysis of a mixture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_fluoride"] beryllium fluoride and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"] sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the
19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than
corresponding processes used for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metals"] alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by
the thermal decomposition of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_iodide"] beryllium iodide was investigated following the success of a similar process
for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.[66]
Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an
alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier.[29] Beryllium could be produced by reducing
beryllium compounds such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_chloride"] beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently, most
beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium.[67] The price on the American
market for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_(metalworking)"] vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.[68]
Between 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes.
It then increased to 230 tonnes by 2018, of which 170 tonnes came from the United States.[69][70]
Etymology
Named after beryl, a semiprecious mineral, from which it was first isolated.[71][72][73]
Applications
Radiation windows
Page 10
Because of its low atomic
number and very low
absorption for X-rays, the
oldest and still one of the
most important applications
of beryllium is in radiation
 windows for X-ray
tubes.[29] Extreme demands
Beryllium target which converts a
proton beam into a neutron beam 
are placed on purity and
cleanliness of beryllium to
avoid artifacts in the X-ray
images. Thin beryllium
foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the
extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by
high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron"] synchrotron radiation.
Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments 
A square beryllium foil mounted in a
steel case to be used as a window

transparent to X-rays owing to its low
 atomic number.
on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In
 scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays
have much lower energies (≈100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.[8]
Low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"] atomic number also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, it is used
to build the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamline"] beam pipe around the collision region in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics"] particle physics setups, such as all four main detector
experiments at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider"] Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb),[74] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevatron"] Tevatron and at SLAC.
The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without
significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize
interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few
degrees above [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero"] absolute zero, and its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetic"] diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex
multipole magnet systems used to steer and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_focusing"] focus the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_beam"] particle beams.[75]
Mechanical applications
Because of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium
metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace"] aerospace industries in high-speed
aircraft, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_missile"] guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope"] James Webb Space Telescope. Several
 liquid-fuel rockets have used [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle"] rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium.[76][77] Beryllium powder was itself
studied as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_fuel"] rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized.[29] A small number of extreme high-end
 bicycle frames have been built with beryllium.[78] From 1998 to 2000, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren"] McLaren [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"] Formula One team
used [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz"] Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloy pistons.[79] The use of beryllium engine
components was banned following a protest by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari"] Scuderia Ferrari.[80]
Mixing about 2.0% beryllium into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"] copper forms an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloy called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_copper"] beryllium copper that is six times stronger
than copper alone.[81] Beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of
elasticity, high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity"] electrical conductivity and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity"] thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic
properties, as well as good [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion"] corrosion and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(material)"] fatigue resistance.[29][6] These applications include non-sparking
tools that are used near flammable gases ( beryllium nickel), in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(device)"] springs and membranes (beryllium nickel
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beryllium_iron&action=edit&redlink=1"] beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices.[29][6] As little as 50 parts per
million of beryllium alloyed with liquid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"] magnesium leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance
and decrease in flammability.[6]
Page 11
The high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in
precision instrumentation, e.g. in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_guidance"] inertial guidance systems and in
the support mechanisms for optical systems.[8] Beryllium-copper
alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needlegun_scaler"] Jason pistols",
which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.[82]  Beryllium copper adjustable wrench
Beryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance
phonograph cartridge styli, where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be
reduced to 1 gram, yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion.[83]
An earlier major application of beryllium was in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake"] brakes for military [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane"] airplanes because of its hardness, high
melting point, and exceptional ability to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_dissipation"] dissipate heat. Environmental considerations have led to
substitution by other materials.[8]
To reduce costs, beryllium can be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloyed with significant amounts of aluminium, resulting in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlBeMet"] AlBeMet
alloy (a trade name). This blend is cheaper than pure beryllium, while still retaining many desirable
properties.
Mirrors
 Beryllium mirrors are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support
structure, are used, for example, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological_satellite"] meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional
 stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control
systems, e.g. in the German-made [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_1"] Leopard 1 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2"] Leopard 2 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_battle_tank"] main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid
movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium
mirror is coated with hard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroless_nickel_plating"] electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical
finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating.
This is particularly applicable to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic"] cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the
coating to buckle.[8]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope"] James Webb Space Telescope has 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors, each plated with a
thin layer of gold.[84] Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated
beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than
 glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures.[85] For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer
Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.[86]
Magnetic applications
Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of
 beryllium-based materials are used by naval or military explosive
ordnance disposal teams for work on or near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_mine"] naval mines, since
these mines commonly have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuze"] magnetic fuzes.[88] They are also
 found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic
fields generated.[89] In the fields of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_communication"] radio communications and
powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are
 used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling
wave tubes, etc.,  that are used for generating high levels of
 microwave power in the transmitters.[90]

Nuclear applications
Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_design"] nuclear weapon designs as the very outer layer of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium_pit"] plutonium pits in the primary stages of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_bomb"] thermonuclear bombs, placed to surround the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissile"] fissile material.
These layers of beryllium are good "pushers" for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implosion_(mechanical_process)"] implosion of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium-239"] plutonium-239, and they are good
 neutron reflectors, just as in beryllium-moderated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactors"] nuclear reactors.[91]
Beryllium is also commonly used in some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_source"] neutron sources in laboratory devices in which relatively few
 neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a particle accelerator-powered neutron
generator). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a
 radioisotope such as polonium-210, radium-226, plutonium-238, or americium-241. In the nuclear reaction
that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation"] transmuted into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in
about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay"] alpha decay driven beryllium neutron
sources, named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulated_neutron_initiator"] "urchin" neutron initiators, were used in some early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bomb"] atomic bombs.[91] Neutron sources in
which beryllium is bombarded with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"] gamma rays from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_decay"] gamma decay radioisotope, are also used to
produce laboratory neutrons.[92]
Beryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU"] CANDU reactors.
The fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance
brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process
with Be as the braze filler material. Bearing pads are brazed in
place to prevent contact between the fuel bundle and the
pressure tube containing it, and inter-element spacer pads are
brazed on to prevent element to element contact.
 Beryllium is also used at the Joint European Torus nuclear- Two CANDU fuel bundles: Each about

advanced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER"] ITER to condition the components which face the
plasma.[93] Beryllium has also been proposed as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladding_(nuclear_fuel)"] cladding 
Notice the small appendages on the fuel
clad surfaces
material for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_rod"] nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination
 of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties.[8] Beryllium
fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent,
 moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride
thorium reactor (LFTR).[94]
Acoustics
 The low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high-frequency speaker
drivers. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than titanium),  hard to shape due to its
brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweeter"] tweeters are limited to high-end home,[95][96][97] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_audio"] pro audio,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address"] public address applications.[98][99] Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed to be
made of the material.[100]
Some high-end [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_cartridge"] phonograph cartridges used beryllium cantilevers to improve tracking by reducing
mass.[101]
Electronic
Page 13
Beryllium is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-type_semiconductor"] p-type [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopant"] dopant in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_materials"] III-V compound semiconductors. It is widely used in materials such as
GaAs, AlGaAs, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InGaAs"] InGaAs and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InAlAs"] InAlAs grown by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_beam_epitaxy"] molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).[102] Cross-rolled
beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board"] printed circuit boards in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology"] surface-mount technology. In
critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_sink"] heat sink. The application also
requires a coefficient of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion"] thermal expansion that is well matched to the alumina and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-reinforced_plastic"] polyimide-glass
substrates. The beryllium-beryllium oxide [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_matrix_composite"] composite "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Material"] E-Materials" have been specially designed for these
electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be
tailored to match diverse substrate materials.[8]
 Beryllium oxide is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an electrical
insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point.
Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_semiconductor_device"] high-power [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor"] transistors in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"] radio frequency
 transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal
 conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets.[103] Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent
lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berylliosis"] berylliosis which developed in the
workers who were making the tubes.[104]
Healthcare
Beryllium is a component of several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_material"] dental alloys.[105][106]
Occupational safety and health
Beryllium is a health and safety issue for workers. Exposure to beryllium in the workplace can lead to a
sensitization immune response and can over time develop [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berylliosis"] chronic beryllium disease (CBD).[107] The
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects
in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent
sensitization and CBD by developing a better understanding of the work processes and exposures that may
present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for
adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of
this collaboration.[107] The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring
occupational exposures to beryllium.[108]
Precautions
Approximately 35 micrograms of beryllium is found in the average
human body, an amount not considered harmful.[110] Beryllium is
chemically similar to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"] magnesium and therefore can displace it from
enzymes, which causes them to malfunction.[110] Because Be2+ is
a highly charged and small ion, it can easily get into many tissues
and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many
enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity
is exacerbated by the fact that the body has no means to control
beryllium levels, and once inside the body the beryllium cannot be
removed.[111] Chronic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berylliosis"] berylliosis is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary"] pulmonary and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"] systemic
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"] granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes
contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short
time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment.
Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop;

 Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended
exposure limit (REL) of constant 500 ng/m3. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLH"] IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is
4 mg/m3.[113] The toxicity of beryllium is on par with other toxic metals, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"] arsenic and
mercury.[114][115]
The toxicity of finely divided beryllium (dust or powder, mainly encountered in industrial settings where
beryllium is produced or machined) is very well-documented. Solid beryllium metal does not carry the
same hazards as airborne inhaled dust, but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly
documented. Workers handling finished beryllium pieces are routinely advised to handle them with gloves,
both as a precaution and because many if not most applications of beryllium cannot tolerate residue of skin
contact such as fingerprints.
Acute beryllium disease in the form of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_pneumonitis"] chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in
 the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent
lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases.[116] Chronic berylliosis resembles
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"] sarcoidosis in many respects, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"] differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in
nuclear weapons design, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_L._Anderson"] Herbert L. Anderson.[117]
Beryllium may be found in coal slag. When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint
and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure.[118]
Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence.
Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be
made to ingest this highly toxic substance.[6] Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great
care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release
of beryllium dust ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"] lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although
the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for
exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal
and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of
other beryllium-containing material.[119]
A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an
international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_bifluoride"] ammonium bifluoride
for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline,
allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration
in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has
been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection
of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).[120][121]

Smaragd entdeckten neuen Erde, wegen ihrer Eigenschaft, süsse Mittelsalze zu bilden, den
Namen Glykine, Süsserde, beilegte, erwartete er wohl nicht, dass sich bald nachher eine
anderweitige Erde finden würde, welche mit völlig gleichem Rechte Anspruch an diesen
Namen machen können. Um daher keine Verwechselung derselben mit der Yttererde zu
veranlassen, würde es vielleicht gerathen seyn, jenen Namen Glykine aufzugeben, und
durch Beryllerde (Beryllina) zu ersetzen; welche Namensveränderung auch bereits vom
Hrn. Prof. Link, und zwar aus dem Grunde empfohlen worden, weil schon ein
Pflanzengeschlecht Glycine vorhanden ist." (When Vauquelin conferred – on account of its
property of forming sweet salts – the name glycine, sweet-earth, on the new earth that had
been found by him in beryl and smaragd, he certainly didn't expect that soon thereafter
another earth would be found which with fully equal right could claim this name. Therefore,
in order to avoid confusion of it with yttria-earth, it would perhaps be advisable to abandon
this name glycine and replace it with beryl-earth (beryllina); which name change was also
recommended by Prof. Link, and for the reason that a genus of plants, Glycine, already
exists.)
