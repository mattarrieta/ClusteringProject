Comparison of subsequent injury
categorisation (SIC) models and their
application in a sporting population

Abstract
Background: The original subsequent injury categorisation (SIC-1.0) model aimed to classify relationships between
chronological injury sequences to provide insight into the complexity and causation of subsequent injury
occurrence. An updated model has recently been published. Comparison of the data coded according to the
original and revised subsequent injury categorisation (SIC-1.0 and SIC-2.0) models has yet been formally compared.
Methods: Medical attention injury data was prospectively collected for 42 elite water polo players over an 8 month
surveillance period. The SIC-1.0 and SIC-2.0 models were retrospectively applied to the injury data. The injury
categorisation from the two models was compared using descriptive statistics.
Results: Seventy-four injuries were sustained by the 42 players (median = 2, range = 0–5), of which 32 injuries
(43.2%) occurred subsequent to a previous injury. The majority of subsequent injuries were coded as occurring
at a different site and being of a different nature, while also being considered clinically unrelated to the
previous injury (SIC-1.0 category 10 = 57.9%; SIC-2.0 clinical category 16 = 54.4%). Application of the SIC-2.0
model resulted in a greater distribution of category allocation compared to the SIC-1.0 model that reflects a
greater precision in the SIC-2.0 model.
Conclusions: Subsequent injury categorisation of sport injury data can be undertaken using either the original
(SIC-1.0) or the revised (SIC-2.0) model to obtain similar results. However, the SIC-2.0 model offers the ability to
identify a larger number of mutually exclusive categories, while not relying on clinical adjudication for category
allocation. The increased precision of SIC-2.0 is advantageous for clinical application and consideration of injury
relationships.

Subsequent injuries, defined as any injury that occurs at
any stage following an initial (index) injury, account for a
large proportion of all injuries that are sustained within
sporting populations. (Finch et al. 2017; Fortington et al.

The original subsequent injury categorisation (SIC-1.0)
model (Finch and Cook 2014) provided ten mutually ex-
clusive categories that extended beyond the limitations of
previous classification models. One of the advancements
provided by the SIC-1.0 model was the ability to distin-

injuries that were sustained at the same body site and
nature to a previous injury. A second iteration of this
model (SIC-2.0) has recently been published, (Toohey
et al. 2018) which provides a two-tiered hierarchical
structure for subsequent injury categorisation (Table 1).
The application of the SIC-2.0 overarching data-driven
level of categorisation has already been demonstrated
in a sporting dataset, (Toohey et al. 2018) but the appli-
cation of sub-categorisation to the clinical level of in-
jury relatedness that the model offers has not been
demonstrated. Nor has there been an evaluation be-
tween the two models’ (SIC-1.0 and SIC-2.0) classifica-
tion outputs, which currently limits the ability to make
comparisons between the two. Thus, the aims of this
study were to: (1) apply the revised SIC-2.0 model to a
sporting dataset to both the data-driven and clinical
sub-categorisation levels and to (2) compare the cat-
egorisation output with the original SIC-1.0 model out-
put within the same sporting injury dataset.
Methods
The classification outputs from both the SIC-1.0 and
SIC-2.0 models were generated based on prospectively col-
lected injury data for 42 elite water polo players (36 women, 
mean age: 19.9 ± 3.4; 6 men, mean age: 20.8 ± 4.1) over
eight consecutive months (August 2013 to March 2014).
All injury data were entered into a centralised database
(Athlete Management System (AMS),  Fusion Sport Pty
Ltd.,  Brisbane, Australia) by the squad’s senior sports
physiotherapist (MJM). A four character Orchard Sports
Injury Classification System 10 (OSICS-10.1) (Rae and
Orchard 2007) injury diagnosis code was assigned pro-
spectively at the time of injury or treatment to each in-
jury by the physiotherapist (MJM),  with the side of
injury occurrence, mechanism of injury, date of injury,
date of return to training, and date of full injury reso-
lution also recorded. All data were de-identified (but
linked by a unique athlete ID) and injuries were time
ordered according to the date of injury for each injured
athlete. (Finch and Fortington 2018)
For SIC-1.0, following the 8 month surveillance period,
the injury data were retrospectively coded using the
SIC-1.0 model (Finch and Cook 2014), again by the same
physiotherapist (MJM).  (Wallis and Drew 2014) For
SIC-2.0, the injury data were retrospectively coded using
the updated model, (Toohey et al. 2018) to both the
data-driven and clinical category levels by one author,
independent to the water polo squad (LAT).  For

consistency, the sub-categorisation of the data-driven
categories reached in the SIC-2.0 model was performed
utilising the original clinical decision that determined
whether or not a subsequent injury was determined to
be clinically related to a previous injury as determined
in the SIC-1.0 model categorisation process. This deci-
sion was used to ensure consistency between model
comparisons. A descriptive analysis is presented to
compare the output of the two models by the number
and percentage within each category. Ethical approval
for the study was obtained from the Human Research
Ethics Committees of the Australian Institute of Sport
and La Trobe University (Approval Number 20160401).
Results
A total of 74 injuries were sustained by 42 athletes over
the surveillance period (median = 2, range = 0–5). Thirty-
two (43.2%) injuries were subsequent to a previous injury
within the surveillance period. Injuries to the shoulder
(n = 17, 23.0%),  elbow (n = 12, 16.2%)  and lumbar
spine (n = 10, 13.5%) were the most frequent accord-
ing to body site. The most common type of injuries 
sustained were impingement (n = 16, 21.6%), joint sprains
(n = 14, 18.2%) and muscle injuries (n = 12, 16.2%).
From the SIC-1.0 model, the majority of subsequent
injury relationships were categorised as category 10 in-
juries (57.9%; injury to a different site and different na-
ture and unrelated to the previous injury/injuries),  or
category 9 injuries (28.1%; injury to a different site and
different nature and related to the previous injury/in-
juries).  Of the ten SIC-1.0 categories, only four (cat-
egories 5, 7, 9, and 10) were identified during the
categorisation process. In total, 38.6% of the subsequent
injuries were determined to be clinically related to a
previous injury (Fig. 1a) (Additional file 1).
Categorisation to the data-driven level of the SIC-2.0
model found category VIII (injury to a different site
and of a different nature) subsequent injury relation-
ships to be the most common (79.3%), followed by cat-
egory VII (12.1%; injuries to a different site, but of the
same nature) (Fig. 1b) (Additional file 1). Sub-categor-
isation to the clinical level of the SIC-2.0 model, identi-

(24.6%; injury to a different site and of a different na-
ture and related) to be the most commonly allocated
categorisation codes (Fig. 1c) (Additional file 1).
When the category allocation was specified to the in-
juries according to the sequence that they were sus-
tained in (i.e. 1st injury, 2nd injury, 3rd injury, 4th
injury, or 5th injury),  it was observed that the most
common type of subsequent injury relationship identi-
fied by the different models was a different site and dif-
ferent nature (SIC-1.0 category 10 and 9; SIC-2.0 data
driven category VIII and SIC-2.0 clinical category 16
and 15) (Fig. 2). Following the second injury being sus-
tained, all of the subsequent injury relationships were
identified to be of a different site and different nature.
Discussion
This is the first paper to apply the SIC-2.0 model to the
clinical sub-categorisation level, considering the influ-
ence that a clinical decision has on the segregation of
subsequent injury categorisation. The application of the
SIC-2.0 model to this level demonstrates the model’s
ability to identify differences between the data-driven
categories.
This study also shows that similar categorisation re-
sults are observed when the SIC-1.0 and SIC-2.0
models are applied to the same dataset. The most com-
mon relationship between injuries within a time-series
categorised them as being of a different site and differ-
ent nature. This finding is consistent with studies
across a range of sports using both the SIC-1.0 model
(Finch et al. 2017; Finch and Cook 2014; Finch et al.
2015; Moore et al. 2018) and the SIC-2.0 model. (Toohey
et al. 2018) The ability of the SIC-2.0 model to identify
and differentiate a larger number of different relationships
between a subsequent injury and the injuries that pre-
ceded it appears to offer a greater sensitivity for more pre-
cise categorisation than the SIC-1.0 model.
Considering the range of criteria that can be used define
a subsequent injury as being clinically-related to a 
previous injury presents a complex question for sports
medicine professionals. There are no established guide-
lines that outline what criteria should be considered
when adjudicating whether a subsequent injury is re-
lated or not to a previous injury, (Toohey et al. 2018)
rather research to date has replied on clinical reasoning
to determine these relationships. (Finch et al. 2017;
Finch and Cook 2014; Moore et al. 2018) The
inter-rater reliability of the SIC-1.0 model, which re-
quires the user to make a decision on injury related-
ness, has been demonstrated to be strong between team
clinicians and moderate to strong between a team clin-
ician and a non-team clinician. (Moore et al. 2018) The
level of agreement between raters reduces however
when a clinician’s categorisation output is compared to
that of a non-clinician rater. (Moore et al. 2018)
We did not attempt to define these criteria within
this study, rather we chose to use an injury dataset that
had previously been coded according to the SIC-1.0
model with the team clinician’s interpretation of what
constituted an injury to be related. There are many po-
tential factors that can be considered by a clinician on
whether an injury is or is not related to a previous in-
jury. (Moore et al. 2018) These include, but are not lim-
ited to: anatomical considerations (the body site, tissue
type, and the side of injury), the time between injury oc-
currences, the biomechanical relationships between body
segments specific to the demands of the sport, the estab-
lished training workload following a previous injury, and
residual deficits or changes in technique related to a previ-
ous injury, or potential changes in psychological status fol-
lowing a previous injury which could all influence the risk
of sustaining a future injury.
To overcome the challenge of determining related-
ness between injuries, at least until there is inter-
national agreement on how this is defined, a stronger
focus on the data-driven categorisation of SIC-2.0 is
recommended. The SIC-2.0 model was designed to
offer an overarching data-driven approach to avoid the
Fig. 2 Application of the SIC-1.0 model (a), data-driven level of SIC-2.0 (b) and clinical level of categorisation (c) according to the injury number
in order of temporal occurrence (Finch et al. 2017; Fortington et al. 2017; Finch and Cook 2014; Toohey et al. 2018; Rae and Orchard 2007)

need for a clinical decision to be made in the categor-
isation process. This provides a standardised method of
categorisation that is reproducible and the automated
ability of the model provides a method free from hu-
man error. (Toohey et al. 2018) This is evidenced by
the 100% inter-rater reliability between two physiother-
apists and between the physiotherapists and the auto-
mated coding script. (Toohey et al. 2018) Concurrently,
outcomes that rely on a subjective clinical decision to
be made in the categorisation process, such as those
produced at the clinical categorisation level of the
SIC-2.0 model and the SIC-1.0 model, should be con-
sidered with some caution and ideally be determined at
the time of injury, not retrospectively. It is acknowl-
edged that an adjudicated determination of clinical re-
latedness between temporal injury sequences may
provide additional valuable information for understand-
ing subsequent injury occurrence. However, further re-
search to determine the most appropriate criteria to
define injury relatedness is required to achieve reliable
categorisation output.
Application of the SIC-2.0 data-driven categorisation
in this study has demonstrated, that even within a small
dataset, a larger distribution of category allocation is
achieved as a greater degree of precision in category al-
location is possible when compared to the original
SIC-1.0 model.
In this study, all of the subsequent injuries that followed
a second injury within a temporal series occurred at a dif-
ferent site to previous injuries. This finding has implica-
tions for clinical rehabilitation which challenges the
preliminary goal of restoring function of the specific in-
jured site to prevent a recurrent injury to the same site.
Medical staff also need to be aware that on return to play
an athlete is at risk of sustaining another injury at a differ-
ent site and rehabilitation should incorporate tertiary pre-
vention strategies to mitigate the risk of different types of
subsequent injury occurring. (Blanch and Gabbett 2016;
Jacobsson and Timpka 2015; Toohey et al. 2017).
Subsequent injury categorisation offers sports injury
researchers the ability to consider injury relationships
beyond recurrent-only injuries, which have been demon-
strated in numerous sports to only account for a very
small proportion of all injuries sustained. (Finch et al.
2017; Toohey et al. 2018; Moore et al. 2018) Consider-
ation of all possible inter-injury relationships provides a
greater insight into the associations and an opportunity
to investigate the mechanisms that underpin subsequent
injury occurrence. (Shrier and Steele 2014) Through
greater understanding, more specifically targeted tertiary
injury prevention strategies can be developed for ath-
letes who have already sustained an injury to help miti-
gate the risk of the subsequent injury types that are
most likely to sequentially occur. 
Conclusion
The categorisation output of subsequent injury data in
sport utilising the original (SIC-1.0) and revised
(SIC-2.0) models offer comparable results. The ability of
the SIC-2.0 model to execute the categorisation process
without the reliance on clinical adjudication offers
greater reliability and also allows non-clinicians to use
the model accurately. The SIC-2.0 model provides a lar-
ger number of mutually exclusive categories, which en-
hances the precision of subsequent injury categorisation
and enables improved analysis of injury relationships.
