To the Enron Executive Committee:
Greg Shea is an external candidate we would like to extend an offer of employment to at
Vice President. This would be to work in Enron Canada as a gas trader. The role will be
based in Calgary. We feel Greg has the necessary experience, skills, knowledge and
relationships to aggressively take this business forward.
Greg has gained much of his experience while at Bankers Trust. In 1999 Greg moved
from a Vice-President role at Bankers Trust in Houston to become Vice-President,
Structured Products, for TransCanada Gas Services (TCGS) located in Calgary, Alberta.
In this capacity, Greg was responsible for developing their highly successful energy

Earlier this year, Greg was named to head up both Trading and Structured Products for
TCGS in Calgary, Alberta. 
Based on these skills and experience we request your approval to proceed.
