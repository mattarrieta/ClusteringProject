Debt Service Mitigation
• Review of existing authorized debt in
conjunction with construction schedule to
determine how much short term and long
term borrowing needs to occur during FY17
–Water Department A/U Debt Service = $482,554
–Sewer Department A/U Debt Service = $695,753
–Reducing these numbers directly reduces the
budget

Impact on Rates
• Using current budget and MWRA assessment
–Water: 4%  Sewer: 10%
–Assumes no change to consumption
• Will have to adjust consumption between tiers based on current
measured consumption changes from last year but we are very
close
• Use Retained earnings to mitigate increase in
rates
–FY15 certified retained earnings
• Water Enterprise Fund: $3.1 M
• Sewer Enterprise Fund: $2.7 M
–At end of FY17 the RE amounts will be one single
number
