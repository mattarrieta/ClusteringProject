Lancaster's Normandy chevauchée of 1356
Lancaster's chevauchée of 1356 in Normandy was an English
offensive directed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Grosmont,_1st_Duke_of_Lancaster"] Henry, Duke of Lancaster, in northern
France during 1356, as a part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War"] Hundred Years' War. The
offensive took the form of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevauch%C3%A9e"] chevauchée, a large mounted raid, and
lasted from 22 June to 13 July. During its final week the English
were pursued by a much larger French army under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_France"] King John II
that failed to force them to battle.
King John had turned against a group of senior Normandy-based
French nobles, headed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Navarre"] Charles II of Navarre, whom John
 believed to be treacherous. Seeing an opportunity, Edward III of
England diverted an expedition planned for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Brittany"] Duchy of Brittany
under Lancaster to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotentin"] Cotentin Peninsula in north-west
Normandy. From there, after gathering some local reinforcements,
Lancaster set off south with 2,300 men. He then pillaged and burnt
his way eastward across the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Normandy"] Duchy of Normandy. King John
moved to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen"] Rouen with a much stronger force, hoping to intercept
Lancaster, but after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_(military)"] relieving and supplying the besieged citadel of
 Pont-Audemer the English turned south. They supplied another
friendly fortification, Breteuil, then stormed and sacked the
important town of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verneuil-sur-Avre"] Verneuil-sur-Avre. John pursued but bungled
several opportunities to bring the English to battle.

and prestige, new alliances had been cemented, there had been few casualties and the French King had
been distracted from the English preparations for a greater chevauchée from south-west France.

Background 
Since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Conquest"] Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and
lands within France, the possession of which made them [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal"] vassals of the kings
of France.[1] On 24 May 1337, following a series of disagreements between
 Philip VI of France (r. 1328–1350) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England"] Edward III of England (r. 1327–1377),
Philip's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conseil_du_Roi"] Great Council in Paris agreed that the lands held by Edward III in
France should be taken into Philip's direct control on the grounds that
Edward III was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War"] Hundred Years' War, which was to last 116 years.[2]
In 1346 Edward led an army across northern France, defeating the French at
 Edward III of England the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cr%C3%A9cy"] Battle of Crécy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)"] laying siege to the port of Calais. With French finances
and morale low after Crécy, Philip failed to relieve the town and it surrendered
on 3 August 1347.[3][4] Following further inconclusive military manoeuvres
by each side, and given that both sides were financially exhausted, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat"] emissaries despatched by Pope
 Clement VI found willing listeners. By 28 September the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truce_of_Calais"] Truce of Calais, intended to bring a temporary
halt to the fighting, had been agreed.[5] This strongly favoured the English, confirming them in possession
of all their territorial conquests.[5] It was to run for nine months to 7 July 1348, but was extended repeatedly
over the years until it was formally set aside in 1355.[6] The truce did not stop ongoing naval clashes
between the two countries, nor small-scale fighting in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gascony"] Gascony and the Duchy of Brittany, nor occasional
fighting on a larger scale.[7][8] A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Gu%C3%AEnes"] treaty ending the war was negotiated at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%C3%AEnes"] Guînes and signed on 6 April
1354. The French king, now [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_France"] John II (r. 1350–1364), decided not to ratify it and it did not take effect. The
latest extension to the truce was due to expire on 24 June. It was clear that from then both sides would be
committed to full-scale war.[9][10]
Prelude
In April 1355, Edward and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia_regis"] his council, with the treasury in an unusually favourable financial position,
decided to launch offensives that year in both northern France and Gascony.[11][12] John attempted to
strongly garrison his northern towns and fortifications against the expected descent by Edward III, at the
same time assembling a field army; after allocating garrisons the French field army was unimpressive,
largely due to lack of money to recruit more men.[13] An English expedition to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Normandy"] Normandy was planned. It
was to be carried out with the cooperation of the French [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnate"] magnate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Navarre"] Charles II of Navarre,[14][15] but Charles
 reneged on the agreement.[16][17] Instead a chevauchée, a large-scale mounted raid, was attempted from the
English enclave of Calais in November.[15][16] The French King had stripped the area of fodder, food and
potential booty, causing the English to return to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calais"] Calais within ten days.[16][18] The raid had achieved
nothing, but did focus French attention on the north.[19][20]
Edward III's eldest son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Prince"] Edward of Woodstock, later commonly known as the Black Prince, was given the
Gascon command[21][22] and arrived in Bordeaux, the capital of English-held Gascony, on 20 September
accompanied by 2,200 English soldiers.[23][24] An Anglo-Gascon force of between 5,000 and 6,000 men
 marched from Bordeaux 300 miles (480 km) to Narbonne and back to Gascony. The Black Prince's
chevauchée of 1355 devastated a wide swathe of French territory and sacked many French towns on the
way.[25][26] While no territory was captured, enormous economic damage was done to France;[27] the
modern historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_J._Rogers"] Clifford Rogers concluded "the importance of the economic attrition of the chevauchée
can hardly be exaggerated."[28] The English component resumed the offensive after Christmas to great
Page 3
effect, and more than 50 French-held towns or fortifications in south-west France were captured during the
following four months.[29] Several local lords went over to the English, bringing a further 30 fortified
places with them.[30]
Money and enthusiasm for the war were running out in France. The modern historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Sumption,_Lord_Sumption"] Jonathan Sumption
describes the French national administration as "fall[ing] apart in jealous acrimony and recrimination".[31]
Much of the north of France was openly defying John and a contemporary chronicler recorded "the King
of France was severely hated in his own realm". [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arras"] Arras rebelled and its citizens killed loyalists. The major
nobles of Normandy refused to pay taxes. On 5 April 1356 they were dining at the table of John's eldest
son (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dauphin_of_France"] dauphin), Charles, when John arrived, accompanied by armed men, and arrested ten of the most
outspoken; four were summarily executed.[32] One of those imprisoned was the notoriously treacherous
Charles of Navarre, one of the largest landholders in Normandy.[32][note 1] The Norman nobles who had
not been arrested, sent to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Navarre"] Navarre for reinforcements, where one of Charles' younger brothers, Louis, was
administering the country. On receiving the news Louis began raising troops.[35] The Norman nobles also
turned to Edward for assistance.[32]
Chevauchée
John's army took control of most of Normandy and laid siege to
those rebel-held fortifications which refused to surrender.[36]
John's son Charles, who as well as being the dauphin was the
 Duke of Normandy, took charge of suppressing these
holdouts.[37] He took personal command of the siege of Évreux,
 the capital of Navarre's holdings in Normandy as Count of
Évreux.[38] He ordered several assaults, which were
unsuccessful. The town of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont-Audemer"] Pont-Audemer was another of
Navarre's Norman possessions which refused to surrender; it fell
to a French force commanded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_de_Houdetot"] Robert de Houdetot, but the  The Duchy of Normandy
citadel held out. Houdetot also ordered assaults, which also
failed, so he drove [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_warfare"] mines towards its walls in an attempt to sap
them. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip,_Count_of_Longueville"] Philip of Navarre, another younger brother of Charles of Navarre, took command of several
adherents of his brother and withdrew to the northern Cotentin.[39] The French King was at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartres"] Chartres concentrating an army with which to respond to whatever moves the English might make.[40] An arrière-
ban, a formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced on 14 May. The response was
unenthusiastic and the call was repeated in late May and again in early June.[41]
Navarre's partisans negotiated an alliance with Edward. The English had been preparing an expedition to
 Brittany under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Grosmont,_1st_Duke_of_Lancaster"] Henry, Duke of Lancaster, as part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Breton_Succession"] War of the Breton Succession; Edward diverted
this to Normandy to support the French rebels.[36] On 1 June an initial force of 140 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men-at-arms"] men-at-arms, 200
archers and 1,400 horses left [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton"] Southampton in 48 ships for the beaches near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vaast_la_Hogue"] St. Vaast la Hogue in the north-
east Cotentin,[37] the same beaches on which the English had landed ten years earlier at the start of the
 Crécy campaign.[36] Horses transported in the ships of the day needed several days rest to recover,
otherwise they were liable to collapse, or even die, when ridden.[42]
On 18 June 1356 Lancaster arrived and brought the strength up to 500 men-at-arms and 800 longbowmen.
They were reinforced by 200 Normans under Philip of Navarre. The English commander [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Knolles"] Robert Knolles
joined Lancaster in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montebourg"] Montebourg with a further 800 men detached from English garrisons in Brittany. The
historian Clifford Rogers suggests that these 2,300 men[note 2] were reinforced by up to 1,700 men from
Navarrese-held fortifications over the following month.[43]

Outward
Lancaster's main objective was to relieve the besieged Navarrese strongholds of Pont-Audemer, Breteuil,
 Tillières-sur-Avre and Évreux, by the time he landed only the first three places were still holding out. In
early June Charles' army had launched a successful assault on Évreux; the Navarrese garrison withdrew to
the citadel, burning most of the town behind them. They then negotiated the handover of the castle to
Charles, in exchange for permission to join their comrades in Breteuil.[44] Lancaster's small army was
delayed for several days at Montebourg, setting off on 22 June[45] and arriving the next day in Carentan, 25
miles (40 km) to the south. So far they had been in relatively friendly territory, but on the 24th they set off
into French-controlled Normandy. Their journey took the form of a typical chevauchée of the time. All
participants were mounted and moved relatively rapidly for armies of the period. Villages were looted and
razed, as were towns and fortifications weak enough to be easily captured; stronger places were ignored.
Parties spread out from the main line of travel, so that a broad swathe of France was pillaged and
devastated.[46] Lancaster was prepared for a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-piece_battle"] set-piece battle if necessary, but was not actively seeking
one.[45]
On 24 June the English force headed south, crossed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vire"] Vire at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torigni-sur-Vire"] Torigni-sur-Vire,
and halted there for the 25th. On the 26th they turned east, burning their way
through western Normandy and crossing the strongly fortified bridge over the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dives_(river)"] Dives after the French garrison abandoned it. Lancaster's small army arrived at
Pont-Audemer four days after leaving Torigni-sur-Vire, which was some 84 miles
(135 km) distant in a straight line. The town was close to falling, as the French
had nearly succeeded in driving their mines under its walls. They fled on hearing
of Lancaster's approach, abandoning their baggage and siege equipment. The
English spent two days provisioning the town and filling in the French
excavations. Detaching 100 men to reinforce the garrison, Lancaster marched
south on 2 July. On the 4th he reached [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conches-en-Ouche"] Conches-en-Ouche, stormed it and razed
it. The next day Breteuil was reached, its besiegers having retired in good order,
and it was resupplied sufficiently to stand a siege for a year.[40][47][48] 
Henry of Grosmont,
Duke of Lancaster
Meanwhile, John had left Chartres with a large force, initially establishing himself at Mantes. When
Lancaster marched east, John believed he was striking for Rouen, and moved his army there.[49] He also
took steps to block the fords across the Seine, in the belief Lancaster may have been heading for Calais.[50]
Once it became clear Lancaster was moving south from Pont-Audemer, John followed.[51] Just 7 miles
(10 km) to the south of Breteuil was the capital of lower Normandy, Verneuil.[52][53] The English
continued their march on 4 July to Verneuil, seized it, looted it and took prisoner anyone who it was
considered might be worth a ransom. The richest men in the district had fortified themselves in Verneuil's
strong [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep"] keep[note 3] with their families and valuables.[54] The historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Burne"] Alfred Burne hypothesised that
French siege equipment had been captured at Pont-Audemer and made storming fortified places a more
viable proposition than earlier in the chevauchée, when they were avoided. In any event, the keep was
assaulted; many English are recorded as being wounded, but none killed.[52] At 6:00 am on the 6th its
defenders negotiated a surrender: they were permitted to leave, but on condition they abandon all their
possessions. These were looted and the keep was then demolished.[54] The attack on Verneuil was
probably motivated by the prospect of looting a rich town;[50] no attempt was made to relieve Navarrese-
held Tillières-sur-Avre, 7 miles (11 km) to the east.[55]
Return
Page 5
By the time the demolition of the keep at Verneuil was complete, on the evening
of 6 July, reports on the approach of the French army were being received. It was
much stronger than the English force; Rogers describes it as "vastly superior ... in
 numbers" with perhaps ten times the number of men. It had moved to Condé-sur-
Iton from Rouen and so was 3 miles (5 km) from the freshly provisioned Breteuil
and only 7 miles (11 km) from Verneuil. On the 7th Lancaster rested his men and
horses,[56][57] but they did so in battle order outside Verneuil in case of a French
attack.[57] The French at Condé-sur-Iton also rested, having marched hard to get
there in two days from Rouen; John probably also wished for all his stragglers
and detachments to join his army before offering battle. On the 8th the English
marched 14 miles (23 km) west to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Aigle"] L'Aigle.[58] The French army was 2 to 3 miles
(3 to 5 km) away.[59] John sent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald"] heralds to Lancaster inviting him to commit his
force to a formal battle. Lancaster replied ambiguously, but John, convinced that
Lancaster's main reason for landing in Normandy was to seek a battle, believed
an agreement had been reached and camped for the night.[note 4][61][62]

The next morning the French prepared themselves for battle, watched from a distance by a detachment of
Navarrese cavalry,[63] and moved off at noon.[60] The English had broken camp during the night and set
off on a long march of 28 miles (45 km) to Argentan. Attempting a pursuit was clearly hopeless,[64] so the
French returned to Breteuil and re-established their siege.[60] A force was sent to Tillières-sur-Avre, which
promptly capitulated.[55] Some French cavalry were trailing Lancaster and he may have believed they were
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard"] van of John's entire army,[65] as on the 10th the English made another long march of 32 miles (51 km)
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thury-Harcourt"] Thury-Harcourt and on the 11th an exceptionally long march of 40 miles (64 km) to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Fromond"] Saint-Fromond on
the Vire,[66] where he avoided a French ambush.[67]
The force returned to Montebourg on 13 July.[67] In 22 days the English had travelled 330 miles (530 km),
a remarkable effort for the period.[68] The three-week expedition had been very successful: two of the
besieged towns had been resupplied, the participants had seized a large amount of loot, including many
horses, damage had been done to the French economy and prestige, the alliance with the Norman nobles
had been cemented, there had been few casualties and the French King had been distracted from the Black
Prince's preparations for a greater chevauchée in south-west France.[67][69]
Aftermath
Philip of Navarre and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffroy_de_Harcourt"] Godfrey d'Harcourt (a prominent and influential Norman noble) acknowledged
Edward III as King of France and did [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_(feudal)"] homage to him for their Norman lands.[67][70] Lancaster moved on
to Brittany with 2,500 men.[71] From there he marched south in mid-August, intending to link up with a
march north by the Black Prince in the vicinity of Tours.[72] He was unable to cross the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loire"] Loire and returned
to Brittany where he laid siege to its capital, Rennes.[73]
When King John received news that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Prince%27s_chevauch%C3%A9e_of_1356"] Black Prince had commenced a chevauchée of his own with an
Anglo-Gascon force moving north from Bergerac, he offered the garrison of Breteuil easy terms to end the
siege. He then assembled a royal army at Chartres,[74] pursued the Anglo-Gascons, cut off their retreat[75]
and forced them to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Poitiers"] battle at Poitiers. The French army was heavily defeated by the smaller Anglo-Gascon
force and John was captured, along with most of his court and much of the nobility of France.[76]
