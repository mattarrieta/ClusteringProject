Proposed (2002) Proxy Disclosure
(Enron Wind Sale) 
DRAFT #4
During 2001, certain Enron subsidiaries and affiliates (defined collectively for purposes
of the following paragraphs as “Enron”) entered into a number of transactions with LJM2
Co-Investment, L.P., a private investment company that primarily engages in acquiring or
investing in energy and communications-related investments (“LJM2”), and its affiliates
involving either assets Enron had previously decided to sell or risk management activities
intended to limit Enron’s exposure to price and value fluctuations with respect to various
assets. Andrew S. Fastow, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of
Enron, is the managing member of LJM2’s general partner. The general partner of LJM2
is entitled to receive a percentage of the profits of LJM2 in excess of the general partner’s
portion of the total capital contributed to LJM2, depending upon the performance of the
investments made by LJM2.
In one such transaction, LJM2 purchased from Enron all of the outstanding capital stock
of Enron Renewable Energy Corp (“EREC”),  an indirect subsidiary of Enron, for
$__________ in cash and $________ in a PIK-preferred security and warrants of EREC.
[Describe reimbursement of expenses, if any, and payment of work fee to LJM2 to
the extent EREC is sold to a party other than LJM2.] [Describe the amount of Mr.
Fastow’s financial interest in the transaction.]  Thetermsofthepurchasewere
negotiated on Enron’s behalf by senior officers of Enron, other than Mr. Fastow, and
approved by Enron’s  Board of Directors, who received an opinion of
[_________________], its financial advisor, that the transaction was fair to Enron and its
stockholders from a financial standpoint. 
Enron acquired EREC (then Zond Energy Systems) in 1996. EREC is a global wind
power company that engages in the manufacturer, sale and installation of wind turbines
with third parties, as well as the development, financing and operations/maintenance of
wind projects. Enron determined to dispose of EREC and discussed a possible sale with
a number of parties, including industry competitors and financial investors. As a result of
this process, Enron determined that a potential sale to LJM2 offered the most favorable
prospects for completing a transaction on terms acceptable to Enron. 
[Insert discussion of other transactions entered into with LJM2 during 2001,
including--if practicable to determine (see above)--financial quantification of the
amount of Mr. Fastow’s interest in transactions between Enron and LJM2.]
Management believes that the terms of the transaction were reasonable and no less
favorable than the terms of the similar agreements with unrelated third parties.
