11:10  A Hard Landing in a Global Knowledge-based Economy
Lester Thurow, Professor of Management and Economics, Sloan School of
Management, MIT
Sharp falls in the stock market and a rapid slowdown in economic growth are testing the new global knowledge-
based economy for the first time. Like the Federal Aviation Administration investigating airplane crashes, there is
much more to be learned from a crash than from a successful flight. What can we learn from this crash about the
nature of the new economy that is in the process of being created? Do the improvements in information
processing, telecommunications, and computers make a difference?
11:50  Strategy and the Internet

The European IT Forum 2001
Michael E. Porter, Professor, Harvard Business School
Much of what has been written about the Internet’s impact on business is wrong. The time has come to abandon
the destructive rhetoric of “e-strategy” and “e-business” and see the Internet for what it is: an enabling
technology that makes strategy more, not less, important and that complements, rather than cannibalizes,
traditional sources of advantage. Those companies that can make the Internet part of a distinctive overall
strategy, rather than see IT as an end in itself, will be those that prosper.
