In September 2019, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures"] Universal Pictures announced its plans to distribute two independently financed thriller
films written and directed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan"] M. Night Shyamalan.[2] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_(film)"] Old was released in July 2021 as the first film in that
partnership.[3] In promotional interviews for Old, Shyamalan said he was working on adapting a novel he
had optioned,[4] telling [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(website)"] Wired that he was halfway done with the first draft.[5] According to Shyamalan, the
film's screenplay was the fastest he had ever written in his career.[6] In October, the film's title was revealed
to be Knock at the Cabin.[7]

 Dave Bautista joined the cast of the film in December 2021.[8][9]
Shyamalan cited Bautista's performance in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049"] Blade Runner 2049 (2017) as
the primary reason he wanted the actor to star in Knock at the Cabin.[10] In
 early 2022, Rupert Grint, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Ben Aldridge, and Jonathan
Groff were added to the cast.[11][12] Insiders told [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Disgusting"] Bloody Disgusting that
 the film would be similar to the 2018 novel The Cabin at the End of the
World by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_G._Tremblay"] Paul G. Tremblay.[13] Principal photography began on April 19,
 2022, in Burlington County, New Jersey, with cinematographer Jarin
Blaschke.[1][14][15] Shyamalan shot the film with 1990s lenses to give it an
"old-school thriller" look.[16] Filming wrapped on June 10, 2022.[17]
Release
Writer, director, and producer
 M. Night Shyamalan 
Knock at the Cabin is scheduled to be theatrically released by Universal
