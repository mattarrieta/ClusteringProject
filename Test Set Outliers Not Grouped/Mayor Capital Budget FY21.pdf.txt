Framingham City Council

November 1, 2019
Honorable City Councilors, 
I am pleased to present the FY2021-FY2025 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for the City of Framingham. 
We took a prudent approach in the development of this plan and view it as a responsible investment in
our City’s vast infrastructure. Capital needs for FY2021- FY2025 total $371.5 million for both the General
Fund and the Utility Enterprise Fund. 
We have worked closely with our School Department and Division Heads to put forward a
recommendation for FY2021 that funds our highest priorities while not overreaching, both financially
and operationally. 
While capital requests from our General Fund totaled more than $45.3 million for FY21, we are
recommending that $17.6 million be authorized, and $27.6 million be deferred to a subsequent year of
the CIP. Within the Utility Enterprise Fund, requests total $18.4 million, of which $16 million is
recommended with $2.4 million deferred. 
Included in this plan are a number of projects that we would like to call your attention to including: 
  $1.2 million energy project package that involves school buildings, city buildings, and park
facilities. 
  Roadway repair, which includes sidewalks and addresses handicapped accessibility for sidewalks
and unaccepted streets otherwise known as private roads and Southside roads (Arlington St.).
  Exterior envelope repairs to schools and city buildings (Memorial Building and Pearl Street
Garage).
  Nobscot Fire Engine replacement. 
  Technology infrastructure replacement and system-wide Library computer replacement, 
including public computers. 
  Westbound Worcester Road water and sewer pipe replacement. (Eastbound is currently
underway.)
  Flagg Drive water pipe replacement (Fuller School)

Like last year, this submission is electronic. You will receive two electronic documents delineating the
debt service calculation associated with borrowing for this plan. You will also receive a link to the capital
improvement plan database itself through an email to your city email address. The database is called
Smartsheet and accessible using your city email address to login and create a password to view all of the
data securely. Our Assistant CFO Jennifer Pratt will send this email to you directly using your city email
address today. We have safely housed the database in "the cloud." All the project information is
provided there, including quotes and estimates attached to each project. Both Jen and Mary Ellen Kelley
are available to walk you through how to access the database if you need assistance. 
The FY2021-FY2025 CIP is a comprehensive plan that fulfills our responsibility as stewards of the City's
assets. 
Sincerely, 
Dr. Yvonne M. Spicer, Mayor
