Gross domestic product
Gross domestic product (GDP) is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"] monetary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_economics"] measure of the
market value of all the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good"] final goods and services produced in a
specific time period by countries.[2][3] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita"] GDP (nominal) per capita
does not, however, reflect differences in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living"] cost of living and the
 inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per
capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when
comparing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living"] living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is
more useful comparing national economies on the international
market.[4] Total GDP can also be broken down into the
contribution of each industry or sector of the economy.[5] The ratio
of GDP to the total population of the region is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_per_capita"] per capita GDP
and the same is called Mean Standard of Living. 
A map of world economies by size of
GDP (nominal) in USD, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank,
2014.[1]
GDP definitions are maintained by a number of national and international economic organizations. The
 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines GDP as "an aggregate
measure of production equal to the sum of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_value_added"] gross values added of all resident and institutional units
engaged in production and services (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in
the value of their outputs)".[6] An [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund"] IMF publication states that, "GDP measures the monetary value of final
goods and services—that are bought by the final user—produced in a country in a given period of time (say
a quarter or a year)."[7]
 GDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic
progress. It is often considered to be the "world's most powerful statistical indicator of national
development and progress".[8] However, critics of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_imperative"] growth imperative often argue that GDP measures
were never intended to measure progress, and leave out key other externalities, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_extraction"] resource extraction,
 environmental impact and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaid_labor"] unpaid domestic work.[9] Critics frequently propose alternative economic models
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut_(economic_model)"] doughnut economics which use other measures of success or alternative indicators such as the
 OECD's Better Life Index as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human
development and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being"] well being.

History
 William Petty came up with a basic concept of GDP to attack
 landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the Dutch
and the English between 1654 and 1676.[10] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Davenant"] Charles Davenant
developed the method further in 1695.[11] The modern concept of
 GDP was first developed by Simon Kuznets for a 1934 US
Congress report, where he warned against its use as a measure of
welfare (see below under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Limitations_and_criticisms"] limitations and criticisms).[12] After the 
Quarterly gross domestic product
 Bretton Woods conference in 1944, GDP became the main tool for
measuring a country's economy.[13] At that time [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_product"] gross national product (GNP) was the preferred estimate,
which differed from GDP in that it measured production by a country's citizens at home and abroad rather
than its 'resident institutional units' (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD"] OECD definition above). The switch from GNP to GDP in the US
was in 1991, trailing behind most other nations. The role that measurements of GDP played in World War
II was crucial to the subsequent political acceptance of GDP values as indicators of national development
and progress.[14] A crucial role was played here by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Department_of_Commerce"] US Department of Commerce under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Gilbert"] Milton Gilbert
where ideas from Kuznets were embedded into institutions.
The history of the concept of GDP should be distinguished from the history of changes in many ways of
estimating it. The value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts, but the value
added by the public sector, by financial industries, and by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_asset"] intangible asset creation is more complex. These
activities are increasingly important in developed economies, and the international conventions governing
their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in GDP regularly change in an attempt to keep up with
industrial advances. In the words of one academic economist, "The actual number for GDP is, therefore,
the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data
to fit them to the conceptual framework."[15]
GDP became truly global in 1993 when China officially adopted it as its indicator of economic
performance. Previously, China had relied on a Marxist-inspired national accounting system.[16]
Determining gross domestic product (GDP)
Page 3
GDP can be determined in three ways, all of which should,
theoretically, give the same result. They are the production (or
output or value added) approach, the income approach, or the
speculated expenditure approach. It is representative of the total
output and income within an economy
The most direct of the three is the production approach, which
sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total.
The expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the
product must be bought by somebody, therefore the value of the
total product must be equal to people's total expenditures in buying
things. The income approach works on the principle that the
incomes of the productive factors ("producers", colloquially) must
be equal to the value of their product, and determines GDP by
finding the sum of all producers' incomes.[17]
Production approach
Also known as the Value Added Approach, it calculates how much
value is contributed at each stage of production.
This approach mirrors the OECD(Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development) definition given above.
1. Estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the
many various economic activities;
2. Determine the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_consumption"] intermediate consumption, i.e., the cost of
material, supplies and services used to produce final
goods or services.
3. Deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to
obtain the gross value added.
 Gross value added = gross value of output – value of intermediate
consumption.
Value of output = value of the total sales of goods and services plus
value of changes in the inventory. 
An infographic explaining how GDP
is calculated in the UK
The sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as "GDP at factor cost".
GDP at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products = "GDP at producer price".
For measuring output of domestic product, economic activities (i.e. industries) are classified into various
sectors. After classifying economic activities, the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following
two methods:
1. By multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them
together
2. By collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding
them together
Page 4
The value of output of all sectors is then added to get the gross value of output at factor cost. Subtracting
each sector's intermediate consumption from gross output value gives the GVA (=GDP) at factor cost.
Adding indirect tax minus subsidies to GVA (GDP) at factor cost gives the "GVA (GDP) at producer
prices".
Income approach
The second way of estimating GDP is to use "the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer
units".[6]
If GDP is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income (GDI), or GDP (I). GDI should
provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later. By definition, GDI is equal to GDP. In
practice, however, measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national
statistical agencies.
This method measures GDP by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they
hire - wages for labour, interest for capital, rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship.
The US "National Income and Expenditure Accounts" divide incomes into five categories:
1. Wages, salaries, and supplementary labour income
2. Corporate profits
3. Interest and miscellaneous investment income
4. Farmers' incomes
5. Income from non-farm unincorporated businesses
These five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost.
Two adjustments must be made to get GDP:
1. Indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices.
2. Depreciation (or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_consumption_allowance"] capital consumption allowance) is added to get from net domestic product
to gross domestic product.
Total income can be subdivided according to various schemes, leading to various formulae for GDP
measured by the income approach. A common one is:
Compensation of employees [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_operating_surplus"] gross operating surplus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_mixed_income"] gross mixed income
GDP =  COE +  GOS +  GMI +
taxes less subsidies on production and imports
TP & M – SP & M
Compensation of employees (COE) measures the total remuneration to employees for
 work done. It includes wages and salaries, as well as employer contributions to social
security and other such programs.
Gross operating surplus (GOS) is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses.
Often called profits, although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_output"] gross output to
calculate GOS.
Gross mixed income (GMI) is the same measure as GOS, but for unincorporated
businesses. This often includes most small businesses.
Page 5
The sum of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income; it is the income of all of the factors of
production in society. It measures the value of GDP at factor (basic) prices. The difference between basic
prices and final prices (those used in the expenditure calculation) is the total taxes and subsidies that the
government has levied or paid on that production. So adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports
converts GDP(I) at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_cost"] factor cost to GDP(I) at final prices.
Total factor income is also sometimes expressed as:
Total factor income = employee compensation + corporate profits + proprietor's income +
rental income + net interest[18]
Expenditure approach
The third way to estimate GDP is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses
except intermediate consumption) measured in purchasers' prices.[6]
Market goods that are produced are purchased by someone. In the case where a good is produced and
unsold, the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves.
Therefore, measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production. This is
known as the expenditure method of calculating GDP.
Components of GDP by expenditure
GDP (Y) is the sum of consumption (C),  investment (I),
government Expenditures (G) and net exports (X – M).
Y = C + I + G + (X − M)
Here is a description of each GDP component:
C (consumption) is normally the largest GDP
component in the economy, consisting of private
 expenditures in the economy (household final
consumption expenditure). These personal
expenditures fall under one of the following categories:
 durable goods, nondurable goods, and services.
Examples include food, rent, jewelry, gasoline, and
medical expenses, but not the purchase of new housing. 
U.S. GDP computed on the
expenditure basis.
I (investment) includes, for instance, business investment in equipment, but does not
include exchanges of existing assets. Examples include construction of a new mine,
purchase of software, or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory. Spending by
households (not government) on new houses is also included in investment. In contrast to its
colloquial meaning, "investment" in GDP does not mean purchases of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market"] financial products.
Buying [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services"] financial products is classed as '[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"] saving', as opposed to investment. This avoids
double-counting: if one buys shares in a company, and the company uses the money
received to buy plant, equipment, etc., the amount will be counted toward GDP when the
company spends the money on those things; to also count it when one gives it to the
company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of
products. Buying [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)"] bonds or companies' [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_capital"] equity shares is a swapping of deeds, a transfer of
claims on future production, not directly an expenditure on products; buying an existing
building will involve a positive investment by the buyer and a negative investment by the
seller, netting to zero overall investment.
Page 6
G (government spending) is the sum of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending"] government expenditures on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good"] final goods and
services. It includes salaries of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_servants"] public servants, purchases of weapons for the military and
any investment expenditure by a government. It does not include any [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_payment"] transfer payments,
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security"] social security or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits"] unemployment benefits. Analyses outside the USA will often treat
government investment as part of investment rather than government spending.
X (exports) represents gross exports. GDP captures the amount a country produces,
including goods and services produced for other nations' consumption, therefore exports are
added.
M (imports) represents gross imports. Imports are subtracted since imported goods will be
included in the terms G, I, or C, and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand"] supply as
domestic.
Note that C, I, and G are expenditures on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good"] final goods and services; expenditures on intermediate goods and
services do not count. (Intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other
goods and services within the accounting year.[19]) So for example if a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_manufacturer"] car manufacturer buys [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_parts"] auto parts,
assembles the car and sells it, only the final car sold is counted towards the GDP. Meanwhile, if a person
buys replacement auto parts to install them on their car, those are counted towards the GDP.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is responsible for calculating the national
accounts in the United States, "In general, the source data for the expenditures components are considered
more reliable than those for the income components [see income method, above]."[20]
GDP and GNI
GDP can be contrasted with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_product"] gross national product (GNP) or, as it is now known, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Income"] gross national income
(GNI). The difference is that GDP defines its scope according to location, while GNI defines its scope
according to ownership. In a global context, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product"] world GDP and world GNI are, therefore, equivalent terms.
GDP is product produced within a country's borders; GNI is product produced by enterprises owned by a
country's citizens. The two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned
by its own citizens, and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries. In practice,
however, foreign ownership makes GDP and GNI non-identical. Production within a country's borders, but
by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country, counts as part of its GDP but not its GNI; on the
other hand, production by an enterprise located outside the country, but owned by one of its citizens, counts
as part of its GNI but not its GDP.
For example, the GNI of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] USA is the value of output produced by American-owned firms, regardless of
where the firms are located. Similarly, if a country becomes increasingly in debt, and spends large amounts
of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased GNI but not a decreased GDP. Similarly,
if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in
decreased GNI, but not decreased GDP. This would make the use of GDP more attractive for politicians in
countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets.
Gross national income (GNI) equals GDP plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income
payments to the rest of the world.[21]
In 1991, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States switched from using GNP to using GDP as its primary measure of
production.[22]The relationship between United States GDP and GNP is shown in table 1.7.5 of the
 National Income and Product Accounts.[23]
International standards
Page 7
The international standard for measuring GDP is contained in the book [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_System_of_National_Accounts_(UNSNA)"] System of National Accounts
(2008), which was prepared by representatives of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund"] International Monetary Fund, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union,
 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank. The
publication is normally referred to as SNA2008 to distinguish it from the previous edition published in
1993 (SNA93) or 1968 (called SNA68) [24]
SNA2008 provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts. The standards
are designed to be flexible, to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions.
National measurement
Within each country GDP is normally
measured by a national government
statistical agency, as private sector
organizations normally do not have
access to the information required
(especially information on expenditure
and production by governments).
Nominal GDP and
adjustments to GDP
The raw GDP figure as given by the
equations above is called the nominal,
historical, or current, GDP. When one
compares GDP figures from one year
to another, it is desirable to compensate
for changes in the value of money –
for the effects of inflation or deflation.
To make it more meaningful for year-
to-year comparisons, it may be
multiplied by the ratio between the
value of money in the year the GDP
was measured and the value of money
in a base year. 
Countries by GDP (PPP) per capita (Int$) in 2017 according to the
IMF
     > $50,000
     $35,000 - $50,000 
     $5,000 - $10,000
     $2,000 - $5,000
     $20,000 - $35,000       < $2,000
     $10,000 - $20,000       No data
For example, suppose a country's
GDP in 1990 was $100 million and its
GDP in 2000 was $300 million.
Suppose also that inflation had halved
the value of its currency over that
period. To meaningfully compare its
GDP in 2000 to its GDP in 1990, we
could multiply the GDP in 2000 by 
Countries by 2019 GDP (nominal) per capita[note 1]
     > $60,000       $20,000 - $30,000      $1,000 - $2,500
     $50,000 - $60,000      $10,000 - $20,000      $500 - $1,000
     $40,000 - $50,000      $5,000 - $10,000      < $500
     $30,000 - $40,000      $2,500 - $5,000      No data
one-half, to make it relative to 1990 as
a base year. The result would be that
the GDP in 2000 equals $300 million × 1⁄2 = $150 million, in 1990 monetary terms. We would see that the
country's GDP had realistically increased 50 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage#Percentage_increase_and_decrease"] percent over that period, not 200 percent, as it might appear
 from the raw GDP data. The GDP adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real, or
constant, GDP.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita_in_2019.svg"]
Page 8
The factor used to convert GDP from current to
constant values in this way is called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_deflator"] GDP deflator.
Unlike [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index"] consumer price index, which measures
inflation or deflation in the price of household
consumer goods, the GDP deflator measures changes
in the prices of all domestically produced goods and
services in an economy including investment goods
and government services, as well as household
consumption goods.[25] 
U.S 2015 GDP computed on the income basis
Constant-GDP figures allow us to calculate a GDP
growth rate, which indicates how much a country's
production has increased (or decreased, if the growth rate is negative) compared to the previous year.
Real GDP growth rate for year n = (Real GDP in year n) −
(Real GDP 
(Real GDP in
in year n − 1) 
year n − 1)
Another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth. If a country's GDP doubled over
a certain period, but its population tripled, the increase in GDP may not mean that the standard of living
increased for the country's residents; the average person in the country is producing less than they were
before. Per-capita GDP is a measure to account for population growth.
Cross-border comparison and purchasing power parity
The level of GDP in countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according
to either the current currency exchange rate, or the purchasing power parity exchange rate.
Current currency exchange rate is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate"] exchange rate at which one currency will be
exchanged for another currency as defined in the official international market.
 Purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing
 power parity (PPP) of a currency relative to a selected standard (usually the United States
dollar). This is a comparative (and theoretical) exchange rate, the only way to directly realize
this rate is to sell an entire [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI"] CPI basket in one country, convert the cash at the currency
market rate & then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country (with the converted
cash). Going from country to country, the distribution of prices within the basket will vary;
typically, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradability"] non-tradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the basket's total cost
in the higher GDP country, per the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balassa%E2%80%93Samuelson_effect"] Balassa–Samuelson effect.
The ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used.
The current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global
currency [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate"] exchange rates. The method can offer better indications of a country's international
purchasing power. For instance, if 10% of GDP is being spent on buying hi-tech foreign
arms, the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates,
since arms are a traded product bought on the international market. There is no meaningful
'local' price distinct from the international price for high technology goods. The PPP method
of GDP conversion is more relevant to non-traded goods and services. In the above example
if hi-tech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by GDP
(PPP) rather than nominal GDP.
There is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in GDP between
high and low income (GDP) countries, as compared to the current exchange rate method. This finding is
called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_effect"] Penn effect.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"]

Standard of living and GDP: wealth distribution and externalities
GDP per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards.[26]
The major advantage of GDP per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured
frequently, widely, and consistently. It is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on
GDP on a quarterly basis, allowing trends to be seen quickly. It is measured widely in that some measure of
GDP is available for almost every country in the world, allowing inter-country comparisons. It is measured
consistently in that the technical definition of GDP is relatively consistent among countries.
GDP does not include several factors that influence the standard of living. In particular, it fails to account
for: 
 Externalities – Economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are
not directly measured in GDP.[27][28] Increased industrial output might grow GDP, but any
pollution is not counted.[29]
Non-market transactions – GDP excludes activities that are not provided through the
market, such as household production, bartering of goods and services, and volunteer or
unpaid services.
Non-monetary economy – GDP omits economies where no money comes into play at all,
resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low GDP figures. For example, in countries with major
business transactions occurring informally, portions of local economy are not easily
registered. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter_(economics)"] Bartering may be more prominent than the use of money, even extending to
services.[28]
Quality improvements and inclusion of new products – by not fully adjusting for quality
improvements and new products, GDP understates true [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth"] economic growth. For instance,
although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the
past, GDP treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value. The
introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in
GDP despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living. For example, even the
richest person in 1900 could not purchase standard products, such as antibiotics and cell
phones, that an average consumer can buy today, since such modern conveniences did not
exist then.
Sustainability of growth – GDP is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not
necessarily a projection.
 Wealth distribution – GDP does not account for variances in incomes of various
demographic groups. See [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics"] income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequality-
based economic measures.[28]
It can be argued that GDP per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors,
capturing them indirectly.[26][30] As a result, GDP per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage
because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with
quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness, quality of life, and well-being.[26]
Limitations and criticisms
Limitations at introduction
Page 10
 Simon Kuznets, the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income,
stated in his second report to the US Congress in 1937, in a section titled "Uses and Abuses of National
Income Measurements":[12]
The valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact
characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria.
With quantitative measurements especially, the definiteness of the result suggests, often
misleadingly, a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured. Measurements
of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse, especially since they
deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the
effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification. [...]
All these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just
as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic
welfare. But in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to
penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values. Economic welfare cannot be
adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known. And no income
measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income, that is, the intensity and
unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income. The welfare of a nation can,
therefore, scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above.
In 1962, Kuznets stated:[31]
Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and
returns, and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more
growth of what and for what.
Further criticisms
Ever since the development of GDP, multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using GDP as the
overarching measure of economic and social progress. For example, many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism"] environmentalists argue that
GDP is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the
environment.[32][33] Furthermore, the GDP does not consider human health nor the educational aspect of a
population.[34] American politician [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy"] Robert F. Kennedy criticized the GDP as a measure of “everything
except that which makes life worthwhile”. He said that it "does not allow for the health of our children, the
quality of their education or the joy of their play.”[35]
Although a high or rising level of GDP is often associated with increased economic and social progress, the
opposite sometimes occurs. For example, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Dr%C3%A8ze"] Jean Drèze and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen"] Amartya Sen have pointed out that an increase in
GDP or in GDP growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living, particularly in areas such
as healthcare and education.[36] Another important area that does not necessarily improve along with GDP
is political liberty, which is most notable in China, where GDP growth is strong yet political liberties are
heavily restricted.[37] GDP does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a
country, because GDP is merely an aggregate measure. An economy may be highly developed or growing
rapidly, but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society. These inequalities often
occur on the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other minority status within countries.[38] This can
Page 11
lead to misleading characterizations of economic well-being if the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_distribution"] income distribution is heavily skewed
toward the high end, as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and
income generated in their country (their purchasing power can decline, even as the mean [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_per_capita"] GDP per capita
rises). GDP per capita measures measures (like aggregate GDP measures) do not account for income
distribution (and tend to overstate the average income per capita). For example, South Africa during
apartheid ranked high in terms of GDP per capita, but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were
 not shared equally among its citizens.[39] An inequality which the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goal 10 amongst other global initiatives aims to address.[40]
GDP excludes the value of household and other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaid_work"] unpaid work. Some, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum"] Martha Nussbaum, argue
that this value should be included in measuring GDP, as household labor is largely a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good"] substitute for goods
and services that would otherwise be purchased with money.[41] Even under conservative estimates, the
value of unpaid labor in Australia has been calculated to be over 50% of the country's GDP.[42] A later
study analyzed this value in other countries, with results ranging from a low of about 15% in Canada (using
conservative estimates) to high of nearly 70% in the United Kingdom (using more liberal estimates). For the
United States, the value was estimated to be between about 20% on the low end to nearly 50% on the high
end, depending on the methodology being used.[43] Because many public policies are shaped by GDP
calculations and by the related field of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_accounts"] national accounts,[44] public policy might differ if unpaid work were
included in total GDP. Some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed
and implemented.[45]
The UK's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Capital_Committee"] Natural Capital Committee highlighted the shortcomings of GDP in its advice to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"] UK
Government in 2013, pointing out that GDP "focuses on flows, not stocks. As a result, an economy can
run down its assets yet, at the same time, record high levels of GDP growth, until a point is reached where
the depleted assets act as a check on future growth". They then went on to say that "it is apparent that the
recorded GDP growth rate overstates the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_growth"] sustainable growth rate. Broader measures of wellbeing and
wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that short-term decisions based solely on what is currently
measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the long-term".
It has been suggested that countries that have authoritarian governments, such as the People's Republic of
China, and Russia, inflate their GDP figures.[46]
Research and development about the relation between GDP and use of GDP and reality
Instances of GDP measures have been considered numbers that are artificial constructs.[48] In 2020
scientists, as part of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Scientists%27_Warning_to_Humanity"] World Scientists' Warning to Humanity-associated series, warned that worldwide
growth in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluence"] affluence in terms of GDP-metrics has increased [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_use"] resource use and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant"] pollutant emissions with
affluent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_citizen"] citizens of the world – in terms of e.g. resource-intensive consumption – being responsible for most
negative environmental impacts and central to a transition to safer, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"] sustainable conditions. They summarised
 evidence, presented solution approaches and stated that far-reaching lifestyle changes need to complement
 technological advancements and that existing societies, economies and cultures incite consumption
 expansion and that the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits societal
change.[49][50][47] Sarah Arnold, Senior Economist at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economics_Foundation"] New Economics Foundation (NEF) stated that
"GDP includes activities that are detrimental to our [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"] economy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"] society in the long term, such as
deforestation, strip mining, overfishing and so on".[51] The number of trees that are net lost annually is
estimated to be approximately 10 billion.[52][53] The global average annual deforested land in the 2015–
2020 demi-decade was 10 million hectares and the average annual net forest area loss in the 2000–2010
decade 4.7 million hectares, according to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Forest_Resources_Assessment_(FRA)"] Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020.[54] According to
one study, depending on the level of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality"] wealth inequality, higher GDP-growth can be associated with more
 deforestation.[55] In 2019 "agriculture and agribusiness" accounted for 24 % of the GDP of Brazil, where a
large share of annual net tropical forest loss occurred and is associated with sizable portions of this
Page 12
 economic activity domain.[56] The
number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"] obese adults was
approximately 600 million (12%) in
2015.[57] In 2013 scientists reported
that large [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"] improvements in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"] health only
lead to modest long-term increases in
GDP per capita.[58] After developing
an abstract metric similar to GDP, the
 Center for Partnership Studies
highlighted that GDP "and other
metrics that reflect and perpetuate
them" may not be useful for facilitating
the production of products and
provision of services that are useful –
or comparatively more useful – to
society, and instead may "actually
encourage, rather than discourage,
 destructive activities".[59][60] Steve
Cohen of the Earth Institute elucidated
that while GDP does not distinguish 
Shown is how the global material footprint and global [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_emissions"] CO2 emissions
from fossil-fuel combustion and industrial processes changed
compared with global GDP.[47]
between different activities (or
lifestyles), "all consumption behaviors
 are not created equal and do not have the same impact on environmental sustainability".[61] Johan
Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, noted that "it's difficult to see if
the current G.D.P.-based [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_model"] model of economic growth can go hand-in-hand with rapid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigation_of_climate_change"] cutting of emissions",
which nations have agreed to attempt under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement"] Paris Agreement in order to mitigate real-world impacts of
climate change.[62] Some have pointed out that GDP did not adapt to sociotechnical changes to give a more
accurate picture of the modern economy and does not encapsulate the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)"] value of new activities such as
delivering price-free information and entertainment on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"] social media.[63] In 2017 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Coyle"] Diane Coyle explained that
GDP excludes much unpaid work, writing that "many people contribute free digital [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(human_activity)"] work such as writing
 open-source software that can substitute for marketed equivalents, and it clearly has great economic value
despite a price of zero", which constitutes a common criticism "of the reliance on GDP as the measure of
economic success" especially after the emergence of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_economy"] digital economy.[64] Similarly GDP does not value
or distinguish for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection"] environmental protection. A 2020 study found that "poor regions' GDP grows faster by
attracting more polluting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(economics)"] production after connection to China's expressway system.[65] GDP may not be a
tool capable of recognizing how much [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_capital"] natural capital agents of the economy are building or protecting.[66]
Proposals to overcome GDP limitations
In response to these and other limitations of using GDP, alternative approaches have emerged.
In the 1980s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen"] Amartya Sen and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum"] Martha Nussbaum developed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach"] capability approach, which
focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country, rather than the
aggregate wealth held within a country. These capabilities consist of the functions that a
person is able to achieve.[67]
 In 1990 Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani Economist at the United Nations, introduced the Human
Development Index (HDI). The HDI is a composite index of life expectancy at birth, adult
literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of GDP, adjusted to
purchasing power parity.
 In 1989, John B. Cobb and Herman Daly introduced Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare
(ISEW) by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable
Page 13
resources and degradation of the environment. The new formula deducted from GDP
(personal consumption + public non-defensive expenditures - private defensive
expenditures + capital formation + services from domestic labour - costs of environmental
degradation - depreciation of natural capital)
In 2005, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Med_Jones"] Med Jones, an American Economist, at the International Institute of Management,
 introduced the first secular Gross National Happiness Index a.k.a. Gross National Well-
being framework and Index to complement GDP economics with additional seven
dimensions, including environment, education, and government, work, social and health
(mental and physical) indicators. The proposal was inspired by the King of Bhutan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness"] GNH
philosophy.[68][69][70]
In 2009 the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union released a communication titled GDP and beyond: Measuring
progress in a changing world[71] that identified five actions to improve indicators of progress
in ways that make them more responsive to the concerns of its citizens.
 In 2009 Professors Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, and Jean-Paul Fitoussi at the Commission
on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress (CMEPSP), formed by
French President, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sarkozy"] Nicolas Sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of GDP
economics to expand the focus to well-being economics with a well-being framework
consisting of health, environment, work, physical safety, economic safety, and political
freedom.
 In 2008, the Centre for Bhutan Studies began publishing the Bhutan Gross National
Happiness (GNH) Index, whose contributors to happiness include physical, mental, and
spiritual health; time balance; social and community vitality; cultural vitality; education; living
standards; good governance; and ecological vitality.[72]
In 2013, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD_Better_Life_Index"] OECD Better Life Index was published by the OECD. The dimensions of the
index included health, economic, workplace, income, jobs, housing, civic engagement, and
 life satisfaction.
 Since 2012, John Helliwell, Richard Layard and Jeffrey Sachs have edited an annual World
Happiness Report which reports a national measure of subjective well-being, derived from a
single survey question on satisfaction with life. GDP explains some of the cross-national
variation in life satisfaction, but more of it is explained by other, social variables (See 2013
World Happiness Report).
In 2019, Serge Pierre Besanger published a "GDP 3.0" proposal which combines an
expanded GNI formula which he calls GNIX, with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_ratio"] Palma ratio and a set of environmental
metrics based on the Daly Rule.[73]
