Georgian architecture
 Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking
countries to the set of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_style"] architectural styles current between 1714 and
 1830. It is named after the first four British monarchs of the House
of Hanover—[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain"] George I, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain"] George II, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom"] George III, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom"] George IV—
who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June
1830. The so-called great Georgian cities of the British Isles were
Edinburgh, Bath, pre-independence Dublin, and London, and to a
lesser extent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York"] York and Bristol.[1] The style was revived in the late
19th century in the United States as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture"] Colonial Revival architecture
and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian
architecture;  in both it is also called Georgian Revival
architecture. In the United States the term "Georgian" is generally
used to describe all buildings from the period, regardless of style; in
Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are "architectural in
intention",[2] and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the
period, though that covers a wide range.
The Georgian style is highly variable, but marked by symmetry and
proportion based on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_architecture"] classical architecture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_architecture"] Greece and Rome,
as revived in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture"] Renaissance architecture. Ornament is also normally
in the classical tradition, but typically restrained, and sometimes
almost completely absent on the exterior. The period brought the
vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest
buildings than had been the case before, replacing English
 vernacular architecture (or becoming the new vernacular style) for
almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end
of the period.
Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and
balance; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the
height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as
a double cube. Regularity, as with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashlar"] ashlar (uniformly cut)
stonework, was strongly approved, imbuing symmetry and
adherence to classical rules: the lack of symmetry, where Georgian
additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible, was
deeply felt as a flaw, at least before [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nash_(architect)"] John Nash began to introduce it
in a variety of styles.[3] Regularity of housefronts along a street was
a desirable feature of Georgian town planning. Until the start of the
 Gothic Revival in the early 19th century, Georgian designs usually
lay within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_order"] Classical orders of architecture and employed a
decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece.

Characteristics
In towns, which expanded greatly during the period, landowners turned into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_developer"] property developers, and rows
of identical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraced_house"] terraced houses became the norm.[4] Even the wealthy were persuaded to live in these in town,
especially if provided with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_square"] square of garden in front of the house. There was an enormous amount of
building in the period, all over the English-speaking world, and the standards of construction were
generally high. Where they have not been demolished, large numbers of Georgian buildings have survived
two centuries or more, and they still form large parts of the core of cities such as London, Edinburgh,
Dublin, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne"] Newcastle upon Tyne and Bristol.
The period saw the growth of a distinct and trained architectural profession; before the mid-century "the
high-sounding title, 'architect' was adopted by anyone who could get away with it".[5] This contrasted with
earlier styles, which were primarily disseminated among craftsmen through the direct experience of the
apprenticeship system. But most buildings were still designed by builders and landlords together, and the
wide spread of Georgian architecture, and the Georgian styles of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"] design more generally, came from
dissemination through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_book"] pattern books and inexpensive suites of engravings. Authors such as the prolific
 William Halfpenny (active 1723–1755) had editions in America as well as Britain.
A similar phenomenon can be seen in the commonality of housing designs in Canada and the United States
(though of a wider variety of styles) from the 19th century down to the 1950s, using pattern books drawn
up by professional architects that were distributed by lumber companies and hardware stores to contractors
and homebuilders.[6]
From the mid-18th century, Georgian styles were assimilated into an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_architecture"] architectural vernacular that became
part and parcel of the training of every architect, designer, builder, carpenter, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonry"] mason and plasterer, from
 Edinburgh to Maryland.[7]
Styles
Georgian succeeded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Baroque"] English Baroque of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren"] Sir Christopher Wren, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vanbrugh"] Sir John Vanbrugh, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Archer"] Thomas Archer,
 William Talman, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Hawksmoor"] Nicholas Hawksmoor; this in fact continued into at least the 1720s, overlapping with
a more restrained Georgian style. The architect [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gibbs"] James Gibbs was a transitional figure, his earlier buildings
are Baroque, reflecting the time he spent in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"] Rome in the early 18th century, but he adjusted his style after
1720.[8] Major [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect"] architects to promote the change in direction from Baroque were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colen_Campbell"] Colen Campbell, author of

European [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour"] Grand Tour became very common for wealthy patrons in
the period, and Italian influence remained dominant,[9] though at

their honour, especially vertical bands connecting the windows.[10]

The styles that resulted fall within several categories. In the
mainstream of Georgian style were both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladian_architecture"] Palladian architecture—
and its whimsical alternatives, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture"] Gothic and Chinoiserie, which were
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world"] English-speaking world's equivalent of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"] European Rococo. From the mid-1760s a range of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture"] Neoclassical
 modes were fashionable, associated with the British architects Robert Adam, James Gibbs, Sir William
Chambers, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wyatt"] James Wyatt, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dance_the_Younger"] George Dance the Younger, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Holland_(architect)"] Henry Holland and Sir [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Soane"] John Soane. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nash_(architect)"] John Nash was
one of the most prolific architects of the late Georgian era known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_architecture"] The Regency style, he was responsible
for designing large areas of London.[11] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture"] Greek Revival architecture was added to the repertory, beginning
 around 1750, but increasing in popularity after 1800. Leading exponents were William Wilkins and Robert
Smirke.
In Britain, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick"] brick or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonry"] stone are almost invariably used;[12] brick is often disguised with stucco. The Georgian
terraces of Dublin are noted for their almost uniform use of red brick, for example, whereas equivalent
terraces in Edinburgh are constructed from stone.[13] In America and other colonies wood remained very
common, as its availability and cost-ratio with the other materials was more favourable. Raked roofs were
mostly covered in earthenware tiles until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pennant,_1st_Baron_Penrhyn"] Richard Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn led the development of the
 slate industry in Wales from the 1760s, which by the end of the century had become the usual material.[14]
Types of buildings
Houses
 Versions of revived Palladian architecture dominated English
country house architecture. Houses were increasingly placed in
grand landscaped settings, and large houses were generally made
wide and relatively shallow, largely to look more impressive from a
distance. The height was usually highest in the centre, and the
Baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent
generally avoided. In grand houses, an entrance hall led to steps up
to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_nobile"] piano nobile or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzanine"] mezzanine floor where the main reception
rooms were. Typically the basement area or "rustic", with kitchens,
offices and service areas, as well as male guests with muddy
boots,[15] came some way above ground, and was lit by windows

that were high on the inside, but just above ground level outside. A
single block was typical, with perhaps a small court for carriages at
the front marked off by railings and a gate, but rarely a stone gatehouse, or side wings around the court.
Page 4
Windows in all types of buildings were large and regularly placed on a grid; this was partly to minimize
 window tax, which was in force throughout the period in the United Kingdom. Some windows were
subsequently bricked-in. Their height increasingly varied between the floors, and they increasingly began
below waist-height in the main rooms, making a small [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcony"] balcony desirable. Before this the internal plan and
 function of the rooms can generally not be deduced from the outside. To open these large windows the sash
window, already developed by the 1670s, became very widespread.[16] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall"] Corridor plans became universal
inside larger houses.[17]
Internal courtyards became more rare, except beside the stables, and the functional parts of the building
were placed at the sides, or in separate buildings nearby hidden by trees. The views to and from the front
and rear of the main block were concentrated on, with the side approaches usually much less important.
The roof was typically invisible from the ground, though domes were sometimes visible in grander
buildings. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roofline"] roofline was generally clear of ornament except for a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balustrade"] balustrade or the top of a pediment.[18]
Columns or pilasters, often topped by a pediment, were popular for ornament inside and out,[19] and other
ornament was generally geometrical or plant-based, rather than using the human figure.
Inside ornament was far more generous, and could sometimes be
overwhelming.[20] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimneypiece"] chimneypiece continued to be the usual
main focus of rooms, and was now given a classical treatment, and
increasingly topped by a painting or a mirror.[21] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasterwork"] Plasterwork
ceilings,[22] carved wood, and bold schemes of wallpaint formed a
backdrop to increasingly rich collections of furniture, paintings,
porcelain, mirrors, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objets_d%27art"] objets d'art of all kinds.[23] Wood-panelling,
very common since about 1500, fell from favour around the mid-
century, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper"] wallpaper included very expensive imports from
China.[24]

Adam, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syon_House"] Syon House, London 
Smaller houses in the country, such as vicarages, were simple
regular blocks with visible raked roofs, and a central doorway,
often the only ornamented area. Similar houses, often referred to as
"villas" became common around the fringes of the larger cities,
especially London,[25] and detached houses in towns remained common, though only the very rich could
afford them in central London.
In towns even most better-off people lived in terraced houses, which typically opened straight onto the
street, often with a few steps up to the door. There was often an open space, protected by iron railings,
dropping down to the basement level, with a discreet entrance down steps off the street for servants and
deliveries; this is known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_(architecture)"] "area".[26] This meant that the ground floor front was now removed and
protected from the street and encouraged the main reception rooms to move there from the floor above.
Often, when a new street or set of streets was developed, the road and pavements were raised up, and the
gardens or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard"] yards behind the houses remained at a lower level, usually representing the original one.[27]
Town terraced houses for all social classes remained resolutely tall and narrow, each dwelling occupying
the whole height of the building. This contrasted with well-off continental dwellings, which had already
begun to be formed of wide apartments occupying only one or two floors of a building; such arrangements
were only typical in England when housing groups of batchelors, as in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxbridge"] Oxbridge colleges, the lawyers in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inns_of_Court"] Inns of Court or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_(London)"] The Albany after it was converted in 1802.[28] In the period in question, only in
 Edinburgh were working-class purpose-built [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenement"] tenements common, though lodgers were common in other
cities. A curving crescent, often looking out at gardens or a park, was popular for terraces where space
allowed. In early and central schemes of development, plots were sold and built on individually, though
there was often an attempt to enforce some uniformity,[29] but as development reached further out schemes
were increasingly built as a uniform scheme and then sold.[30]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Syon_House_2.jpg"]
Page 5
The late Georgian period saw the birth of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-detached"] semi-detached house, planned systematically, as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb"] suburban
compromise between the terraced houses of the city and the detached "villas" further out, where land was
cheaper. There had been occasional examples in town centres going back to medieval times. Most early
suburban examples are large, and in what are now the outer fringes of Central London, but were then in
areas being built up for the first time. Blackheath, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk_Farm"] Chalk Farm and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_Wood"] St John's Wood are among the areas
contesting being the original home of the semi.[31] Sir [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Summerson"] John Summerson gave primacy to the Eyre Estate of
St John's Wood. A plan for this exists dated 1794, where "the whole development consists of pairs of semi-
detached houses, So far as I know, this is the first recorded scheme of the kind". In fact the French Wars
put an end to this scheme, but when the development was finally built it retained the semi-detached form,
"a revolution of striking significance and far-reaching effect".[32]
Churches
Until the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Building_Act_1818"] Church Building Act 1818, the period saw relatively few
churches built in Britain, which was already well-supplied,[33]
 although in the later years of the period the demand for Non-
conformist and Roman Catholic places of worship greatly
increased.[34] Anglican churches that were built were designed
internally to allow maximum audibility, and visibility, for
preaching, so the main [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"] nave was generally wider and shorter than
in medieval plans, and often there were no side-aisles. Galleries
were common in new churches. Especially in country parishes, the
external appearance generally retained the familiar signifiers of a
Gothic church, with a tower or spire, a large west front with one or
more doors, and very large windows along the nave, but all with
any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary. Where funds
permitted, a classical temple portico with columns and a pediment
might be used at the west front. Interior decoration was generally
chaste; however, walls often became lined with plaques and
monuments to the more prosperous members of the
congregation.[35] 
 St Martin-in-the-Fields, London
(1720), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gibbs"] James Gibbs
In the colonies new churches were certainly required, and generally
repeated similar formulae. British Non-conformist churches were
often more classical in mood, and tended not to feel the need for a
tower or steeple.
The archetypal Georgian church is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Martin-in-the-Fields"] St Martin-in-the-Fields in
London (1720), by Gibbs, who boldly added to the classical temple
façade at the west end a large steeple on top of a tower, set back
slightly from the main frontage. This formula shocked purists and
foreigners, but became accepted and was very widely emulated, at
 home and in the colonies,[36] for example at St Andrew's Church,
 Chennai in India. And in Dublin, the extremely similar St. George's
Church, Dublin. 
The courtyard of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_House"] Somerset House,
from the North Wing entrance. Built
for government offices.
The 1818 Act allocated some public money for new churches required to reflect changes in population, and
a commission to allocate it. Building of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioners%27_church"] Commissioners' churches gathered pace in the 1820s, and
continued until the 1850s. The early churches, falling into the Georgian period, show a high proportion of
 Gothic Revival buildings, along with the classically inspired.[37]
Page 6
Public buildings
Public buildings generally varied between the extremes of plain boxes with grid windows and Italian Late
Renaissance palaces, depending on budget. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_House"] Somerset House in London, designed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Chambers"] Sir William Chambers
in 1776 for government offices, was as magnificent as any country house, though never quite finished, as
funds ran out.[38] Barracks and other less prestigious buildings could be as functional as the mills and
factories that were growing increasingly large by the end of the period. But as the period came to an end
many commercial projects were becoming sufficiently large, and well-funded, to become "architectural in
intention", rather than having their design left to the lesser class of "surveyors".[39]
Colonial Georgian architecture
Georgian architecture was widely disseminated in the English
colonies during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_era"] Georgian era. American buildings of the
Georgian period were very often constructed of wood with
clapboards; even columns were made of timber, framed up, and
turned on an oversized lathe. At the start of the period the
difficulties of obtaining and transporting brick or stone made them a
common alternative only in the larger cities, or where they were
obtainable locally. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College"] Dartmouth College, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University"] Harvard University and the
 College of William and Mary offer leading examples of Georgian
architecture in the Americas.  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park_Barracks,_Sydney"] Hyde Park Barracks (1819),
Georgian architecture in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney"] Sydney
Unlike the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_architecture"] Baroque style that it replaced, which was mostly used
for palaces and churches, and had little representation in the British
colonies, simpler Georgian styles were widely used by the upper and middle classes. Perhaps the best
remaining house is the pristine [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond-Harwood_House"] Hammond-Harwood House (1774) in Annapolis, Maryland, designed by
the colonial architect [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Buckland_(architect)"] William Buckland and modelled on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Pisani_(Montagnana)"] Villa Pisani at Montagnana, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"] Italy as depicted
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Palladio"] Andrea Palladio's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_quattro_libri_dell%27architettura"] I quattro libri dell'architettura ("The Four Books of Architecture").
After independence, in the former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies"] American colonies, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_architecture"] Federal-style architecture represented the equivalent
of Regency architecture, with which it had much in common.
In Canada, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Empire_Loyalist"] United Empire Loyalists embraced Georgian architecture as a sign of their fealty to Britain,
 and the Georgian style was dominant in the country for most of the first half of the 19th century. The
Grange, for example, is a Georgian manor built in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"] Toronto in 1817. In Montreal, English-born architect
 John Ostell worked on a significant number of remarkable constructions in the Georgian style such as the
 Old Montreal Custom House and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_s%C3%A9minaire_de_Montr%C3%A9al"] Grand séminaire de Montréal.
In Australia, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_residential_architectural_styles#Old_Colonial_Georgian_Style"] Old Colonial Georgian residential and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_non-residential_architectural_styles#Georgian"] non-residential styles were developed in the period
from c. 1810 – c. 1840.
Post-Georgian developments
After about 1840, Georgian conventions were slowly abandoned as a number of revival styles, including
 Gothic Revival, that had originated in the Georgian period, developed and contested in Victorian
architecture, and in the case of Gothic became better researched, and closer to their originals. Neoclassical
architecture remained popular, and was the opponent of Gothic in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Styles"] Battle of the Styles of the early
Victorian period. In the United States the Federalist Style contained many elements of Georgian style, but
incorporated revolutionary symbols.
Page 7
In the early decades of the twentieth century when there was a
growing nostalgia for its sense of order, the style was revived and
 adapted and in the United States came to be known as the Colonial
Revival. The revived Georgian style that emerged in Britain during
the same period is usually referred to as Neo-Georgian; the work
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Lutyens"] Edwin Lutyens[40][41] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Harris"] Vincent Harris includes some
examples. The British town of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welwyn_Garden_City"] Welwyn Garden City, established in
the 1920s, is an example of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche"] pastiche or Neo-Georgian development
of the early 20th century in Britain. Versions of the Neo-Georgian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winfield_House"] Winfield House in London was

few architects who continued the neo-Georgian style into the
 1960s. Both in the United States and Britain, the Georgian style is still employed by architects like Quinlan
Terry, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bicknell"] Julian Bicknell, Ben Pentreath, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAM_Architecture"] Robert Adam Architects, and Fairfax and Sammons for private
residences. A debased form in commercial housing developments, especially in the suburbs, is known in
the UK as mock-Georgian.
