Korean ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"] South Korean: 
한국어  조선말 , hangugeo; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea"] North Korean: , chosŏnmal)
is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_language"] native language for about 80 million people, mostly of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans"] Korean
descent.[a][1] It is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language"] official and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_language"] national language of both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea"] North Korea and
 South Korea (geographically Korea), but over the past 74 years of political
 division (and the isolation of North Korea), the two Koreas have developed
 language differences. Beyond Korea, the language is a recognised minority
 language in parts of China, namely Jilin Province, and specifically Yanbian
Prefecture and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changbai_Korean_Autonomous_County"] Changbai County. It is also spoken in parts of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"] Russian
island of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakhalin"] Sakhalin and parts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia.[2]

The exact relationship between Korean and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japonic"] Japonic languages (e.g.,
Japanese) is unclear;[3][4][5] there is a long-standing controversy whether
 perceived similarities between the two languages should be attributed to a
 common origin or rather to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_convergence"] mutual influence. The language has a few [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_language"] extinct
relatives which—along with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_language"] Jeju language of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Island"] Jeju Island and Korean itself
—form the compact [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreanic_language_family"] Koreanic language family. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_homeland"] linguistic homeland of
Korean is suggested to be somewhere in Manchuria.[2] The hierarchy of the
society from which the language originates deeply influences the language,
leading to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_speech_levels"] system of speech levels and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_honorifics"] honorifics indicative of the formality
of any given situation.
Modern Korean is written in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul"] Korean script (
한글; Hangul in South
Korea), a system developed in the 15th century for that purpose. The script
uses 24 basic letters (jamo) and 27 complex letters formed from the basic
 ones. When first recorded in historical texts, Korean was only a spoken
language; all written records were maintained in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese"] Classical Chinese, which,
even when spoken, is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility"] not intelligible to someone who speaks only Korean.
Later, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters"] Chinese characters adapted to the Korean language, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja"] Hanja, were used
to write the language and are still used to a very limited extent in South Korea.
Since the turn of the 21st century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_culture"] Korean culture has spread to other countries
through cultural exports such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_drama"] K-dramas and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop"] K-pop in a movement dubbed
 "the Korean wave". Interest in Korean language acquisition (as a foreign
language) is also generated by longstanding alliances, military involvement,
and diplomacy, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_relations"] South Korea–United States, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93North_Korea_relations"] China–North Korea and
 North Korea–Russia, since the end of World War 2 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War"] Korean War. The
language is ranked in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Language_Aptitude_Battery"] top difficulty level for English speakers by the U.S.
Department of Defense.

History 
Countries with native Korean-speaking
populations (established immigrant communities
in green).
 Modern Korean descends from Middle Korean, which in turn descends from Old Korean, which descends from the Proto-Koreanic
language which is generally suggested to have its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urheimat"] linguistic homeland.[6][7] Whitman (2012) suggests that the proto-Koreans, already
present in northern Korea, expanded into the southern part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula"] Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC and coexisted with the
descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later founder effect
diminished the internal variety of both language families.[8]
Since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War"] Korean War, through 70 years of separation, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_differences_in_the_Korean_language"] North–South differences have developed in standard Korean, including
variations in pronunciation and vocabulary chosen, but these minor differences can be found in any of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_dialects"] Korean dialects, which are
still largely [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_intelligible"] mutually intelligible.
Writing systems 
 Chinese characters arrived in Korea (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Xenic_pronunciations"] Sino-Xenic pronunciations for further
information) together with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhism during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto%E2%80%93Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea"] Proto-Three Kingdoms era in
the 1st century BC. They were adapted for Korean and became known as
Hanja, and remained as the main script for writing Korean for over a millennium
alongside various phonetic scripts that were later invented such as Idu, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gugyeol"] Gugyeol
and Hyangchal. Mainly privileged elites were educated to read and write in
Hanja. However, most of the population was illiterate.
In the 15th century, King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_the_Great"] Sejong the Great personally developed an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet"] alphabetic
 featural writing system known today as Hangul.[9][10] He felt that Hanja was
The oldest Korean dictionary (1920) 
inadequate to write Korean and that this was the cause of its very restricted use;
Hangul was designed to either aid in reading Hanja or replace Hanja entirely.
Introduced in the document [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunminjeongeum"] Hunminjeongeum, it was called eonmun (colloquial
script) and quickly spread nationwide to increase literacy in Korea. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul"] Hangul was widely used by all the Korean classes, but often
treated as amkeul ("script for women") and disregarded by privileged elites, whereas [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja"] Hanja was regarded as jinseo ("true text").
Consequently, official documents were always written in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja"] Hanja during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon"] Joseon era. Since most people couldn't understand Hanja,
Page 3
Korean kings sometimes released public notices entirely written in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul"] Hangul as early as the 16th century for all Korean classes,
including uneducated peasants and slaves. By the 17th century, the elite class of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangban"] Yangban exchanged Hangul letters with their slaves,
suggesting a high literacy rate of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul"] Hangul during the Joseon era.[11]
Today, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja"] Hanja is largely unused in everyday life due to its inconvenience, but it is still important for historical and linguistic studies.
Neither South Korea nor North Korea opposes the learning of Hanja, though they are not officially used in North Korea anymore,
and their usage in South Korea is mainly reserved for specific circumstances, such as newspapers, scholarly papers, and
disambiguation.
Names
The Korean names for the language are based on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Korea"] names for Korea used in both South Korea and North Korea. The English word
"Korean" is derived from Goryeo, which is thought to be the first Korean dynasty known to Western nations. Korean people in the
 former USSR refer to themselves as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koryo-saram"] Koryo-saram and/or Koryo-in (literally, "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Korea#Goryeo"] Koryo/Goryeo person(s)"), and call the language
 Koryo-mal. Some older English sources also use the spelling "Corea" to refer to the nation, and its inflected form for the language,
culture and people, "Korea" becoming more popular in the late 1800s.[12]
In South Korea, the Korean language is referred to by many names including hanguk-eo ("Korean language"), hanguk-mal ("Korean
speech") and uri-mal ("our language"); "hanguk" is taken from the name of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Empire"] Korean Empire (
대한제국 大韓帝國 ;  ; Daehan
Jeguk). The "han" (
韓) in Hanguk and Daehan Jeguk is derived from Samhan, in reference to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea"] Three Kingdoms of Korea (not the
ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula),[13][14] while "-eo" and "-mal" mean "language" and "speech", respectively.
Korean is also simply referred to as guk-eo, literally "national language". This name is based on the same [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja"] Han characters (
國語
"nation" + "language") that are also used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"] Taiwan and Japan to refer to their respective national languages.
In North Korea and China, the language is most often called Joseon-mal, or more formally, Joseon-o. This is taken from the North
Korean name for Korea (Joseon), a name retained from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_dynasty"] Joseon dynasty until the proclamation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Empire"] Korean Empire, which in
turn was annexed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan"] Empire of Japan.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"] mainland China, following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term Cháoxiǎnyǔ or the short
form Cháoyǔ has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and Yanbian, whereas Hánguóyǔ or the short
form Hányǔ is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea.
Classification
Korean is a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreanic"] Koreanic family along with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_language"] Jeju language. Some linguists have included it in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_languages"] Altaic family, but the
core Altaic proposal itself has lost most of its prior support.[15] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_language"] Khitan language has several vocabulary items similar to Korean
that are not found in other Mongolian or Tungusic languages, suggesting a Korean influence on Khitan.[16]
The hypothesis that Korean could be related to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"] Japanese has had some supporters due to some overlap in vocabulary and similar
 grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as Samuel E. Martin[17] and Roy Andrew Miller.[18] Sergei
Anatolyevich Starostin (1991) found about 25% of potential [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"] cognates in the Japanese–Korean 100-word [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list"] Swadesh list.[19]Some
linguists concerned with the issue between Japanese and Korean, including Alexander Vovin, have argued that the indicated
 similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a sprachbund effect and heavy borrowing, especially from Ancient
Korean into Western [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Japanese"] Old Japanese.[20] A good example might be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Korean"] Middle Korean sàm and Japanese asá, meaning "hemp".[21] This
word seems to be a cognate, but although it is well attested in Western Old Japanese and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ryukyuan_languages"] Northern Ryukyuan languages, in Eastern
Old Japanese it only occurs in compounds, and it is only present in three dialects of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ryukyuan_languages"] Southern Ryukyuan language group. Also,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublet_(linguistics)"] doublet wo meaning "hemp" is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryukyuan languages. It is thus plausible to assume
a borrowed term.[22] (See [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_the_Japonic_languages"] Classification of the Japonic languages or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Japanese_and_Korean"] Comparison of Japanese and Korean for further details on a
possible relationship.)
Hudson & Robbeets (2020) suggested that there are traces of a pre-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivkh_languages"] Nivkh substratum in Korean. According to the hypothesis,
ancestral varieties of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivkh_languages"] Nivkh (also known as Amuric) were once distributed on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_peninsula"] Korean peninsula before the arrival of Koreanic
speakers.[23]
Phonology
Korean syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C), consisting of an optional onset consonant, glide /j, w, ɰ/ and final coda /p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, l/
surrounding a core vowel.

B. The semivowels /w/ and /j/ are represented in Korean writing by modifications to vowel symbols (see below).
Assimilation and allophony
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"] IPA symbol ⟨◌͈⟩ (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenseness"] Tensed
consonants /p͈/, /t͈/, /k͈/, /t͡ɕ͈/, /s͈/. Its official use in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensions_to_the_IPA"] Extensions to the IPA is for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortis_and_lenis"] 'strong' articulation, but is used in the literature for
 faucalized voice. The Korean consonants also have elements of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_voice"] stiff voice, but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized
consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"] glottis and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract
walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.
 /s/ is aspirated [sʰ] and becomes an alveolo-palatal [ɕʰ] before [j] or [i] for most speakers (but see North–South differences in the
Korean language). 
버Th
섯is occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/
(example: beoseot (  ) 'mushroom').
/h/ may become a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilabial_consonant"] bilabial [ɸ] before [o] or [u], a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_consonant"] palatal [ç] before [j] or [i], a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_consonant"] velar [x] before [ɯ], a voiced [ɦ] between voiced
sounds, and a [h] elsewhere.
/p, t, t͡ɕ, k/ become voiced [b, d, d͡ʑ, ɡ] between voiced sounds.
/m, n/ frequently denasalize at the beginnings of words.
/l/ becomes alveolar flap [ɾ] between vowels, and [l] or [ɭ] at the end of a syllable or next to another /l/. Note that a written syllable-
final '
ㄹ', when followed by a vowel or a glide (i.e., when the next character starts with '
ㅇ'), migrates to the next syllable and thus
becomes [ɾ].
Traditionally, /l/ was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before [j], and otherwise became /n/. However, the inflow
of western [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konglish"] loanwords changed the trend, and now word-initial /l/ (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation
of either [ɾ] or [l]. The traditional prohibition of word-initial /l/ became a morphological rule called "initial law" (
두음법칙) in South
Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial /l/ in North Korea.
All [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruent"] obstruents (plosives, affricates, fricatives) at the end of a word are pronounced with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_audible_release"] no audible release, [p̚, t̚, k̚].
Plosive stops /p, t, k/ become nasal stops [m, n, ŋ] before nasal stops.
 Hangul spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical
morphology. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.
One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial [ɾ], and initial [n]. For
example,
"labor" – north: rodong (
로동), south: nodong (
노동)
"history" – north: ryeoksa (
력사), south: yeoksa (
역사)
"female" – north: nyeoja (
녀자), south: yeoja (
여자)

Grammar
Korean is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language"] agglutinative language. The Korean language is traditionally considered to have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_parts_of_speech"] nine parts of speech. Modifiers
generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The sentence structure or basic
form of a Korean sentence is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb"] subject–object–verb (SOV), but the verb is the only required and immovable element and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_order"] word order is
highly flexible, as in many other agglutinative languages.

The relationship between a speaker/writer and their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar)"] subject and audience is paramount in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_grammar"] Korean grammar. The relationship between
the speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific"] honorifics, whereas that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in
 speech level.
Honorifics
When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's
superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if they are an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an
employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if they are a younger stranger, student, employee, or the
like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences, and both
honorific or normal sentences.
Honorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical. The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more
complex and stratified than those used today. The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture
and society. Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant. Honorifics are also used for
people who are superior in status. For example, older people, teachers, and employers.[24]
Speech levels
There are seven verb [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"] paradigms or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_speech_levels"] speech levels in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to
indicate the level of formality of a situation.[25] Unlike honorifics—which are used to show respect towards the referent (the person
spoken of) —speech levels are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience (the person spoken to). The names of
the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood"] imperative form of the verb 
하다  체 (hada, "do") in each level, plus the suffix
("che", Hanja: 
體), which means "style".
The three levels with high politeness (very formally polite, formally polite, casually polite) are generally grouped together as
jondaenmal (
존댓말  반말 ), whereas the two levels with low politeness (formally impolite, casually impolite) are banmal (  ) in Korean.
The remaining two levels (neutral formality with neutral politeness, high formality with neutral politeness) are neither polite nor
impolite.
Nowadays, younger-generation speakers no longer feel obl
반말igated to lower their usual regard toward the referent. It is common to see
younger people talk to their older relatives with banmal (  ). This is not out of disrespect, but instead it shows the intimacy and the
closeness of the relationship between the two speakers. Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today's rapidly changing
society have brought about change in the way people speak.[24]
Gender
In general, Korean lacks [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"] grammatical gender. As one of the few exceptions, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_singular"] third-person singular pronoun has two different
forms: 
그geu (male) and 
그녀geunyeo (female). Before 
그녀was invented in need of translating 'she' into Korean, 
그was the only
one third-person singular pronoun, and had no grammatical gender. Due to its origin 
그녀 is never used in spoken Korean but only
appears in writings.
In order to have a more complete understanding of intricacies of gender within the Korean language, we can look at the three models
of language and gender that have been proposed: the deficit model, the dominance model, and the cultural difference model. In the
deficit model, male speech is seen as the default, and any form of speech that diverges from this norm (female speech) is seen as
lesser than. The dominance model sees women as lacking in power due to living within a patriarchal society. The cultural difference
model proposes that the difference in upbringing between men and women can explain the differences in their speech patterns. It is
important to look at these models so that one can better understand the misogynistic conditions that shaped the way men and women
use the Korean language. Korean's lack of grammatical gender makes it different from most European languages. Rather, gendered
differences in Korean can be observed through formality, intonation, word choice, etc.[26]
However, one can still find stronger contrasts between genders within Korean speech. Some examples of this can be seen in: (1)
softer tone used by women in speech; (2) a married woman introducing herself as someone's mother or wife, not with her own name;
(3) the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms (for example, a sajang is a company president and yŏsajang is
a female company president.); (4) females sometimes using more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_question"] tag questions and rising tones in statements, also seen in speech
from children.[27]
Between two people of asymmetrical status in a Korean society, people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of
solidarity. Koreans prefer to use kinship terms, rather than any other terms of reference.[28] In traditional Korean society, women
have long been in disadvantaged positions. Korean social structure traditionally was a patriarchically dominated family system that
emphasized the maintenance of family lines. This structure has tended to separate the roles of women from those of men.[29]
Page 7
Cho and Whitman (2019) explain that the different categories like male and female in social conditions influence the Korean
language features. What they noticed was the word "Jagi (
자기)". Before explaining the word "Jagi (
자기)", one thing that needs to
be clearly distinguished is that "Jagi (
자기)" can be used in a variety of situations, not all of which mean the same thing, but it
depends on the context. Parallel variable solidarity and affection move the convention of speech style, especially terms of address that
Jagi (
자기 'you') has emerged as a gender-specific second-person pronoun used by women. However, unlike the preceding, young
Koreans use the word "Jagi (
자기)" to their lovers or spouses regardless of gender. Among middle-aged women, the word "Jagi (
자
기)" is sometimes used when calling someone who is close to them.
Korean society's prevalent attitude towards men being in public (outside the home) and women living in private still exists today. For
instance, the word for husband is bakkath|yangban (
바깥양반 'outside' 'nobleman') whereas a husband introduces his wife as
an|salam (
안사람  외 an 'inside' 'person'). Also in Kinship terminology, Oy (  'outside' or 'wrong') is added for maternal grandparents,
creating oy-hal-abeoji and oy-hal-meoni (
외할아버지, 
외할머니 'grandfather and grandmother'), differentiating lexicons for males
and females, revealing patriarchal society. Further, in interrogatives to an addressee of equal or lower status, Korean men tend to use
'haessnya (
했냐? 'did it?’)' in aggressive masculinity, whereas women use 'haessni (
했니? 'did it?’)' as a soft expression.[30] However,
not all of the foregoing are always correct. If we observe how Korean society used the question endings '-ni (
니)' and '-nya (
냐)', the
ending '-ni (
니)' prevailed not only among women but also among men until a few decades ago. In fact, '-nya (
냐)' was characteristic
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeolla"] Jeolla and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chungcheong"] Chungcheong dialects. However, since the 1950s, large numbers of people have moved to Seoul from Chungcheong
and Jeolla, and as a result, they began to influence the way men speak. Recently, women also use the term '-nya (
냐)'. To sum up, in
the case of '-ni (
니)', even if one is not close or younger than yourself, it is usually used for people who need to be polite, and in the
case of '-nya (
냐)', it is used mainly for close friends regardless of gender.
Like the case of "actor" and "actress," it also is possible to add a gender prefix to emphasize: biseo (
비서 'secretary') sometimes is
combined with yeo (
여'female') to form yeo-biseo (
여비서  남자  간호사 'female secretary'); namja (  'man') often is added to ganhosa (
'nurse') for the base word to be namja-ganhosa (
남자간호사 'male nurse') to indicate a male nurse. Note that this isn't a matter of
whether or not to omit; it's about addition. Words without those prefixes don't sound awkward at all nor do they remind listeners of
 political correctness.
Another crucial difference between genders of men and women is the tone and pitch of their voices and how that affects the
perception of politeness. Upspeak Men learn to use an authoritative falling tone, and in Korean culture a deeper voice is associated
with being more polite. In addition to the deferential speech endings being used, men are seen as more polite as well as impartial and
professional. When compared to women who use a rising tone in conjunction with the -yo (
요) ending, they are not perceived to be
as polite as men. The -yo (
요) ending also indicates uncertainty due to how this ending has many prefixes which indicate uncertainty
and questioning. While the deferential ending does not have any prefixes which can indicate uncertainty. The -habnida (
합니다)
ending is the most polite and formal form of Korea, while the -yo (
요) ending is less polite and formal which is where the perception
of women being less professional originates from.[30][31]
Hedges soften an assertion and its function as a euphemism in women's speech in terms of discourse difference. Women expected to
add nasal sounds, neyng, neym, 
이ne
거y-
로ey, more frequently than men at
이the
걸로last syllable. The sound L is often added in women's for
female stereotypes that igeolo (  'this thing') become igeollo (  'this thing') to refer a lack of confidence and passive
construction.[24]
Women use more linguistic markers such as exclamation eomeo (
어머 'oh') and eojjeom (
어쩜 'what a surprise') to cooperative
communication.[30]
Vocabulary
Sino-Korean
The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean
words. However, a significant proportion of the vocabulary,
especially words that denote abstract ideas, are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Korean_vocabulary"] Sino-Korean words
(of Chinese origin),[32] either:
 directly borrowed from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Chinese"] written Chinese, or
coined in Korea or Japan using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters"] Chinese characters.
Most of the vocabulary consists of these two sets of words: native
Korean and Sino-Korean. Therefore, just like other words, Korean
has [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_numerals"] two sets of numeral systems. English is similar, having native
English words and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinate"] Latinate equivalents such as water-aqua,  fire-
flame, sea-marine, two-dual, sun-solar, star-stellar. However, unlike
 English and Latin which belong to the same Indo-European
languages family and bear a certain resemblance, Korean and

Chinese are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_relationship_(linguistics)"] genetically unrelated and the two sets of Korean words differ completely from each other. All Sino-Korean [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme"] morphemes
are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosyllabic_language"] monosyllabic as in Chinese, whereas native Korean morphemes can be polysyllabic. The Sino-Korean words were deliberately
imported alongside corresponding Chinese characters for a written language and everything was supposed to be written in Hanja, so
the coexistence of Sino-Korean would be more thorough and systematic than that of Latinate words in English. To a much lesser
extent, some words have also been borrowed from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_language"] Mongolian and other languages.[33]
The exact proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary is a matter of debate. Sohn (2001) stated 50–60%.[32] In 2006 the same author
gives an even higher estimate of 65%.[34] Jeong Jae-do, one of the compilers of the dictionary Urimal Keun Sajeon, asserts that the
proportion is not so high. He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule"] colonial period include many unused Sino-
Korean words. In his estimation, the proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as low as 30%.[35]
Western loanwords
The vast majority of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword"] loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, approximately 90% of which are from English.[32]
Many words have also been borrowed from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_languages"] Western languages such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"] German via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"] Japanese (
아르바이트 ([URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88"] areubaiteu) "part-time
job", 
알레르기  기브스 (allereugi) "allergy",  (gibseu or gibuseu) "plaster cast used for broken bones"). Some Western words were
bor
ダーrow
スed indirec
다tly
스via Japanese during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule"] Japanese occupation of Korea, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example "dozen" >
dāsu >  daseu. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current "Hangulization" rules for the
 respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as "German(y)" (see names
of Germany), the first part of whose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exonym_and_endonym"] endonym Deutschland [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German"] [ˈdɔʏtʃlant] the Japanese approximated using the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji"] kanji 
獨逸 doitsu that
were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: 
獨 dok + 
逸 il = [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EB%8F%85%EC%9D%BC"] Dogil. In South Korean official
use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented "Hangeulizations" of the countries'
endonyms or English names.
Because of such a prevalence of
콩글Engl
리쉬ish in modern South Korean culture and society, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_borrowing"] lexical borrowing is inevitable. English-
derived Korean, or "Konglish" (  ), is increasingly used. The vocabulary of the South Korean dialect of the Korean language
is roughly 5% loanwords (excluding Sino-Korean vocabulary).[24] However, due to North Korea's isolation, such influence is
lacking in North Korean speech.
Korean uses words adapted from English in ways that may seem strange or unintuitive to native English speakers. For example,
fighting (
화이팅 파이팅 /  hwaiting / paiting) is a term of encouragement, like 'come on'/'go (on)'  in English. Something that is
'service' (
서비스  아파트 seobiseu) is free or 'on the house'. A building referred to as an 'apart' (  apateu) is an 'apartment' (but in fact
refers to a residence more akin to a condominium) and a type of pencil that is called a 'sharp' (
샤프) is a mechanical pencil. Like other
borrowings, many of these idiosyncrasies, including all the examples listed above, appear to be imported into Korean via Japanese, or
influenced by Japanese. Many English words introduced via Japanese pronunciation have been reformed, as in 
멜론 (melon) which
was once called 
메론(meron) as in Japanese.
There are also several words derived from nouns used to describe western culture. "kokain" ({
코카인}), for example, is a Korean
term used to describe younger Caucasian females. It is a reference to the drug "cocaine", because of their lighter skin, as it shares the
same spelling and pronunciation. Other words can also be used the other way, such as calling a friend a ({
양키} "yangki") or
"Yankee" for their bold or western-styled personality.
North Korea
 North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_government"] political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign influences on the Korean language in the North. In the early years, the North Korean
government tried to eliminate Sino-Korean words. Consequently, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign
borrowings which are not in North Korean.
Writing system
Before the creation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul"] the modern Korean alphabet, known as Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea and as Hangul in South Korea, people in
Korea (known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon"] Joseon at the time) primarily wrote using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese"] Classical Chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate
Hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil.[36][37][38][39] However, due to the fundamental
differences between the Korean and Chinese languages and the large number of characters to be learned, the lower classes, who
often didn't have the privilege of education, had much difficulty in learning how to write using Chinese characters. To assuage this
problem, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_the_Great"] King Sejong (r. 1418–1450) created the unique alphabet known as Hangul to promote literacy among the common
people.[40]
The Korean alphabet was denounced and looked down upon by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangban"] yangban aristocracy, who deemed it too easy to learn,[41][42] but
it gained widespread use among the common class[43] and was widely used to print popular novels which were enjoyed by the
common class.[44] With growing Korean nationalism in the 19th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabo_Reform"] Gabo Reformists' push, and the promotion of Hangul in
Page 9
schools,[45] in 1894, Hangul displaced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja"] Hanja as Korea's national script.[46] Hanja are still used
to a certain extent in South Korea, where they are sometimes combined with Hangul, but this
method is slowly declining in use, even though students learn Hanja in school.[47]

The letters of the Korean alphabet are not written linearly like most alphabets, but instead arranged into blocks that represent
 syllables

"syllabic blocks" before.
Modern Korean is written with spaces between words, a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese (except when Japanese is written
exclusively in hiragana, as in children's books). The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_mark"] marks used for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation"] Korean punctuation are almost identical to Western ones.
Traditionally, Korean was written in columns, from top to bottom, right to left, like traditional Chinese. However, the syllabic blocks
are now usually written in rows, from left to right, top to bottom, like English.
Dialects
Korean has numerous small local [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect"] dialects (called mal (
말) [literally 'speech'],
saturi (
사투리  방언 ),  or bang'eon (  ).  The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_language"] standard language (pyojun-eo or
pyojun-mal) of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the
area around Seoul (which, as Hanyang, was the capital of Joseon-era Korea for
500 years),  though the northern standard after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War"] Korean War has been
influenced by the dialect of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang"] P'yŏngyang. All dialects of Korean are similar to
each other and largely [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_intelligible"] mutually intelligible (with the exception of dialect-specific
 phrases or non-Standard vocabulary unique to dialects), though the dialect of
Jeju Island is divergent enough to be sometimes classified as a separate
language.[48][49][50] One of the more salient differences between dialects is the
use of tone: speakers of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_dialect"] Seoul dialect make use of vowel length, whereas
speakers of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongsang_dialect"] Gyeongsang dialect maintain the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch-accent_language"] pitch accent of Middle Korean.
Some dialects are conservative, maintaining Middle Korean sounds (such as z, β,
ə) which have been lost from the standard language, whereas others are highly
innovative.
Kang Yoon-jung et al. (2013),[51] Kim Mi-ryoung (2013),[52] and Cho Sung-
hye (2017)[53] suggest that the modern Seoul dialect is currently undergoing Regional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialects_of_Korean"] dialects of Korean
tonogenesis, based on the finding that in recent years [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortis_and_lenis"] lenis consonants (
ㅂㅈㄷ
ㄱ), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant"] aspirated consonants (
ㅍㅊㅌㅋ  ㅃㅉㄸㄲ ) and fortis consonants (  ) were shifting from a distinction via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_onset_time"] voice onset time to that of
pitch change; however, Choi Ji-youn et al. (2020) disagree with the suggestion that the consonant distinction shifting away from
voice onset time is due to the introduction of tonal features, and instead proposes that it is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)"] prosodically-conditioned change.[54]
There is substantial evidence for a history of extensive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_levelling"] dialect levelling, or even [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution"] convergent evolution or intermixture of two or more
originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is
etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, for example "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic_chives"] garlic chives"

translated into Gyeongsang dialect /t͡ɕʌŋ.ɡu.d͡ʑi/ (
정구지  부추 ; jeongguji) but in Standard Korean, it is /puːt͡ɕʰu/ (  ; buchu). This
suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present.[55] See also the
 Japanese–Koguryoic languages hypothesis.
Nonetheless, the separation of the two Korean states has resulted in increasing differences among the dialects that have emerged over
time. Since the allies of the newly founded nations split the Korean peninsula in half after 1945, the newly formed Korean nations
have since borrowed vocabulary extensively from their respective allies. As the Soviet Union helped industrialize North Korea and
establish it as a communist state, the North Koreans therefore borrowed a number of Russian terms. Likewise, since the United States
helped South Korea extensively to develop militarily, economically, and politically, South Koreans therefore borrowed extensively
from English.
The differences among northern and southern dialects have become so significant that many North Korean defectors reportedly have
had great difficulty communicating with South Koreans after having initially settled into South Korea. In response to the diverging
vocabularies, an app called Univoca was designed to help North Korean defectors learn South Korean terms by translating them into
North Korean ones.[56] More information can be found on the page [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_differences_in_the_Korean_language"] North-South differences in the Korean language.
Aside from the standard language, there are few clear boundaries between Korean dialects, and they are typically partially grouped
according to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Korea"] regions of Korea.[57][58]
Recently, both North and South Korea's usage rate of the regional dialect have been decreasing due to social factors. In North Korea,
the central government is urging its citizens to use [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munhwa%C5%8F"] Munhwaŏ (the standard language of North Korea), to deter the usage of foreign
language and Chinese characters: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un"] Kim Jong-un said in a speech "if your language in life is cultural and polite, you can achieve
harmony and comradely unity among people."[59] In South Korea, due to relocation in the population to Seoul to find jobs and the
usage of standard language in education and media, the prevalence of regional dialects has decreased.[60] Moreover, internationally,
due to the increasing popularity of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop"] K-pop, the Seoul standard language has become more widely taught and used.

 Daecheongdo in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongjin_County"] Ongjin County of Incheon.
Hwanghae dialect was originally more similar to the Gyeonggi dialect, but as the division
between North and South Korea prolonged, it is now heavily influenced by the Pyongan dialect.
It is also the least existential dialect of all Korean dialects, and there has been little study
regarding the dialect.
Due to a high amount of Korean war refugees, areas such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incheon"] Incheon close to Hwanghae, have
large populations of people originally from Hwanghae. Thus, certain phrases and words from
the dialect can seldom be heard among older residents of such cities.

Seoul, Incheon, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonggi_Province"] Gyeonggi region (South Korea), as well as Kaeseong, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaepoong&action=edit&redlink=1"] Gaepoong and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpung"] Changpung
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea"] North Korea.
Seoul dialect, which was the basis of Pyojuneo, is a subdialect of Gyeonggi dialect.
About 70% of all Seoul dialect vocabulary has been adopted as Pyojuneo, and only about 10%
out of 30% of Seoul dialect vocabulary that has not been adopted in Pyojuneo have been used
so far.
Gyeonggi dialect is the least existential dialect in South Korea, and most people do not know
that Gyeonggi dialect itself exists. So, Gyeonggi-do residents say they only use standard
language, and many people know the language spoken by Gyeonggi-do residents as standard
language in other regions.
Recently, young people have come to realize that there is a dialect in Seoul as they are
exposed to the Seoul dialect through media such as YouTube.[62][63]
Among the Gyeonggi dialects, the best known dialect along with Seoul dialect is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suwon"] Suwon
dialect. The dialects of Suwon and its surrounding areas are quite different from those of
northern Gyeonggi Province and surrounding areas of Seoul.[64]
In some areas of the southern part of Gyeonggi Province, which is close to Chungcheong
Province, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeongtaek"] Pyeongtaek and Anseong, it is also included in the Chungcheong dialect
area. Local residents living in these areas also admit that they speak Chungcheong dialect.
Traditionally, coastal areas of Gyeonggi, particularly Incheon, Ganghwa, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongjin"] Ongjin and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimpo"] Gimpo
have been recorded to have some influence from the dialects of Hwanghae and Chungcheong,
due to historic intermixing with the two regions, as well as geographical proximity. This old
influence, however, has largely died out among most middle aged and younger locals from the
region.
Originally, northern Gyeonggi Province, including Seoul, received influence from Northern
dialects (Areas of Kaeseong along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryesong_River"] Ryesong River, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganghwa_Island"] Ganghwa Island, received an
especially high amount of influence from the Hwanghae dialect), while southern Gyeonggi
Province was influenced from Chungcheong dialect. However, as a result of the prolonged
division and the large number of migrants from Chungcheong Province and Jeolla Province to
Seoul, the current way of speaking in Gyeonggi has been greatly influenced by Chungcheong
and Jeolla.

Gangwon Province is divided between Yeongseo and Yeongdong due to the Taebaek
Mountains, so even if it is the same Gangwon Province, there is a significant difference in
dialect between the two regions.
In the case of the Yeongseo dialect, the accent is slightly different from the dialect of Gyeonggi
Province, but most of the vocabulary is similar to the dialect of Gyeonggi Province.
Unlike the Yeongseo dialect, Yeongdong dialect has a tone, such as Hamgyeong dialect and
Gyeongsang dialect.
Gangwon dialect is the least spoken dialect of all dialects in South Korea except Jeju.

Daejeon, Sejong, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chungcheong_Province"] Chungcheong region (South Korea)
Chungcheong dialect is considered to be the softest dialect to hear among all dialects of
Korean.
Chungcheong dialect is one of the most recognized dialects in South Korea, along with Jeolla
dialect and Gyeongsang dialect.
Chungcheong dialect was the most commonly used dialect by aristocrats(Yangban) during the
Joseon Dynasty, along with dialects in northern Gyeongsang Province.
In the case of Chungcheong dialect, it is a dialect belonging to the central dialect along with
Gyeonggi, Gangwon, and Hwanghae dialects, but some scholars view it as a separate dialect
separated from the central dialect. In addition, some scholars classify southern Chungcheong
dialect regions such as Daejeon, Sejong, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongju"] Gongju as the southern dialect such as Jeolla
and Gyeongsang dialects.

Gwangju, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeolla_Province"] Jeolla region (South Korea)
Jeolla dialect is a dialect that feels rough along with Gyeongsang dialect. Especially it is well
known for its swearing.
Jeolla dialect speakers, along with Gyeongsang dialect speakers, have high self-esteem in
their local dialects.
Many Jeolla dialect speakers can be found not only in Jeolla Province but also in Seoul and
Gyeonggi Province, because Jeolla Province itself was alienated from development, so many
Jeolla residents came to Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.
Much of Northern Jeolla, especially in areas close to Southern Chungcheong like Jeonju,
 Gunsan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanju"] Wanju have traditionally had weaker accents compared to the south, and in some
cases, might be more closer to the Chungcheong dialect in terms of vocabulary and intonation.

and ") are standard (although 
『』and 
「」are also used).

Remarks
아빠트(appateu/appat'ŭ) is also used in the North.
The Japanese pronunciation of 
조선말was used throughout Korea and
Manchuria during
대J
한ap
민an
국ese Imperial Rule, but after liberation, the government
chose the name (Daehanminguk) which was derived from the name
immediately prior to Japanese Imperial Rule. The syllable 
한(Han) was drawn
 from the same source as that name (in reference to the Han people). Read
more.
동무was originally a non-ideological word for "friend" used all over the Korean
peninsula, but North Koreans later adopted it as the equivalent of the
Communist term of address "comrade". As a result, to South Koreans today the
word has a heavy poli
친tic
구al tinge, and
벗so they have shifted to using o
친th
구er words
for friend like chingu (  ) or beot (  ). South Koreans use chingu (  ) more
often than beot (
벗).
Such changes were made after the Korean War and the
ideological battle between the anti-Communist government in the
South and North Korea's communism.[68][69]
Geographic distribution
Korean is spoken by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans"] Korean people in both South Korea and North Korea, and by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_diaspora"] Korean diaspora in many countries
 including the People's Republic of China, the United States, Japan, and Russia. Currently, Korean is the fourth most popular foreign
language in China, following English, Japanese, and Russian.[70] Korean-speaking minorities exist in these states, but because of
 cultural assimilation into host countries, not all ethnic Koreans may speak it with native fluency.
Official status
 Korean is the official language of South Korea and North Korea. It, along with Mandarin
 Chinese, is also one of the two official languages of China's Yanbian Korean Autonomous
Prefecture.
In North Korea, the regulatory body is the Language Institute of the Academy of Social
Sciences (
사회과학원 어학연구소 社會科學院語學硏究所 ;  , Sahoe Gwahagweon Eohag
 Yeonguso). In South Korea, the regulatory body for Korean is the Seoul-based National
Institute of the Korean Language, which was created by presidential decree on 23 January
1991.
King Sejong Institute 
Highway sign in Korean and English,
Daegu, South Korea
Established pursuant to Article 9, Section 2, of the Framework Act on the National Language, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Sejong_Institute"] King Sejong Institute[71] is a
public institution set up to coordinate the government's project of propagating Korean language and culture; it also supports the King
Sejong Institute, which is the institution's overseas branch. The King Sejong Institute was established in response to:
An increase in the demand for Korean language education;
a rapid increase in Korean language education thanks to the spread of the culture ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallyu"] hallyu), an increase in
international marriage, the expansion of Korean enterprises into overseas markets, and enforcement of employment
licensing system;
the need for a government-sanctioned Korean language educational institution;
the need for general support for overseas Korean language education based on a successful domestic language
education program.
TOPIK Korea Institute
Page 26
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPIK"] TOPIK Korea Institute is a lifelong educational center affiliated with a variety of Korean universities in Seoul, South Korea,
whose aim is to promote Korean language and culture, support local Korean teaching internationally, and facilitate cultural
exchanges.
The institute is sometimes compared to language and culture promotion organizations such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Sejong_Institute"] King Sejong Institute. Unlike that
organization, however, the TOPIK Korea Institute operates within established universities and colleges around the world, providing
educational materials. In countries around the world, Korean embassies and cultural centers (
한국문화원) administer TOPIK
examinations.[72]
As a foreign language
For native English speakers, Korean is generally considered to be one of the most difficult [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_language"] foreign languages to master despite the
relative ease of learning Hangul. For instance, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States' [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Language_Institute"] Defense Language Institute places Korean in Category IV with
Japanese, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"] Chinese ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Mandarin"] Mandarin and Cantonese), and Arabic, requiring 64 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 26 weeks for
Category I languages like Italian, French, and Spanish) to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency
in which they have "sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements" and "can deal with concrete
topics in past, present, and future tense."[73][74] Similarly, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Service_Institute"] Foreign Service Institute's School of Language Studies places Korean
in Category IV, the highest level of difficulty.[75]
The study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_American"] Korean American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_language_learning"] heritage language students; in 2007 they
were estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities.[76] However, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_Institute"] Sejong Institutes in the
United States have noted a sharp rise in the number of people of other ethnic backgrounds studying Korean between 2009 and 2011;
they attribute this to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Wave"] rising popularity of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Pop"] South Korean music and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_drama"] television shows.[77] In 2018 it was reported that the rise in K-Pop
was responsible for the increase in people learning the language in US universities.[78]
Testing
 There are two widely used tests of Korean as a foreign language: the Korean Language Proficiency Test (KLPT) and the Test of
Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK). The Korean Language Proficiency Test, an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers'
competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.[79] The TOPIK was
first administered in 1997 and was taken by 2,274 people. Since then the total number of people who have taken the TOPIK has
surpassed 1 million, with more than 150,000 candidates taking the test in 2012.[80] TOPIK is administered in 45 regions within
South Korea and 72 nations outside of South Korea, with a significant portion being administered in Japan and North America,
which would suggest the targeted audience for TOPIK is still primarily foreigners of Korean heritage.[81] This is also evident in
TOPIK's website, where the examination is introduced as intended for Korean heritage students.
