study

Abstract
Background: The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate whether runners with certain biomechanical
or clinical/anthropometrical characteristics sustain more running-related injuries than runners with other
biomechanical or clinical/anthropometrical characteristics.
Methods: The study was designed as a prospective cohort with 52-weeks follow-up. A total of 224 injury-free,
recreational runners were recruited from the Gothenburg Half Marathon and tested at baseline. The primaryexposure variables were biomechanical and clinical/anthropometrical measures, including strength, lower extremity
kinematics, joint range of motion, muscle flexibility, and trigger points. The primary outcome measure was any
running-related injury diagnosed by a medical practitioner. Cumulative risk difference was used as measure of
association. A shared frailty approach was used with legs as the unit of interest. A total of 448 legs were included in
the analyses.
Results: The cumulative injury incidence proportion for legs was 29.0% (95%CI = 24.0%; 34.8%). A few
biomechanical and clinical/anthropometrical factors influence the number of running-related injuries sustained in
recreational runners. Runners with a late timing of maximal eversion sustained 20.7% (95%CI = 1.3; 40.0) more
injuries, and runners with weak abductors in relation to adductors sustained 17.3% (95%CI = 0.8; 33.7) more injuries,
compared with the corresponding reference group.
Conclusions: More injuries are likely to occur in runners with late timing of maximal eversion or weak hip
abductors in relation to hip adductors.

Background
Risk factors for running-related injury (RRI) have been
explored in several original studies and synthesized in
various systematic reviews (Ceyssens et al. 2019; Sara-
giotto et al. 2014; Hulme et al. 2017). Although the at-
tempts to identify risk factors for RRI in the original
articles included in these systematic reviews have been
extraordinary, 86 out of 89 studies used a relative meas-
ure of association (e.g. odds ratio, relative risk, or hazard
rate ratio) instead of absolute measures of association.
Relative measures of association enable researchers to
identify whether runners with certain characteristics are
at higher or lower risk of RRI. For example, a recent
study revealed knee stiffness as a significant predictor of
injury, with an odds ratio of 1.18 (Messier et al. 2018).
This reveals an 18% increased odds of sustaining RRI
amongst those with high knee stiffness compared with
those with low knee stiffness. Although this sounds
alarming, the reader is unable to evaluate the magnitude
of this value. Possibly, the 18% would be of practical
importance if the odds in the low group were 0.50 and
the odds in the high group were 0.59. However, it is also
possible that the odds in the low group were 0.005 and
the odds in the high group were 0.0059, which does not
imply a clinically important difference. It is not flawed to
include relative measures of association, but the limited
value for practical decision-making has been highlighted
and the relevance of a ratio-based result remains unclear
(Nielsen et al. 2017).  Moving closer to a result that is
suitable for runners and their coaches, researchers
within the running injury thematic also need to consider
using absolute measures of association, such as cumula-
tive risk difference (RD). RD allows the reader to assess
if the potential differences between exposure groups are
relevant with regard to the magnitude of the difference.
Absolute differences have been reported in biomech-
anical studies, although these differences are normally
between injury groups and not between exposure groups
(Ceyssens et al. 2019; Powers 2010).  In prospective
cohort studies, the most common analytical approach
has been to compare differences in biomechanical mea-
sures, such as external knee adduction moments (Dudley
et al. 2017), ankle eversion range of motion and eversion
velocity (Kuhman et al. 2016), and hip strength (Finnoff
et al. 2011),  between injured and non-injured runners.
Studies identifying such differences give some informa-
tion on possible risk factors. However, comparing
injured and non-injured subjects is not considered best
practice in prospective cohort studies, as the comparison
should be between exposed and non-exposed. For
instance, studies can identify whether there is a differ-
ence between injured and non-injured runners in terms
of knee adduction moments, but are unable to judge
whether runners with a high value of knee adduction 
moments sustain more or less injuries compared with
those runners who have a low value. Addressing the lat-
ter will assist in identifying who sustains most injuries
and, if an absolute measure of association is used,
whether or not the difference is meaningful for runners
and their coaches.
In addition to that most studies use relative mea-
sures of association, a majority of studies using abso-
lute measures of association have compared injured
and non-injured runners (except a few training (Niel-
sen et al. 2014a; Ramskov et al. 2018a; Ramskov et al.
2018b),  demographic characteristics (Nielsen et al.
2013),  and foot pronation (Nielsen et al. 2014b) stud-
ies). Therefore, more studies are needed which use an
absolute measure of association when examining the
association between biomechanical or clinical/anthro-
pometrical characteristics and RRI. Consequently, the
purpose of the present explorative study was to inves-
tigate whether runners with certain biomechanical or
clinical/anthropometrical characteristics sustain more
RRI than runners with other biomechanical or clin-
ical/anthropometrical characteristics.
Methods
The study was designed as a 52-week prospective co-
hort study. All runners who participated in the study
provided written consent prior to baseline examin-
ation. Ethical approval (DNR: 712–15) for the study
and its design was obtained from the Gothenburg re-
gional ethical review board. The study took place in
Gothenburg, Sweden, and the runners were recruited
from the Gothenburg Half Marathon e-mail lists pro-
vided by the Gothenburg Athletic Association. A flow
chart of the recruitment procedure is presented in
Fig. 1. Runners were eligible for inclusion if they did
not experience any musculoskeletal injury in the
lower extremities 6 months prior to baseline examin-
ation, were between the ages of 18 and 55, had an
average weekly running volume of at least 15 km for
the past 12 months prior to baseline examination, did
not use orthopaedic insoles during running, were not
pregnant, and/or did not suffer from diabetes. At
baseline, participants underwent a clinical/anthropo-
metrical examination assessing joint range of motion,
muscle flexibility and trigger points, a biomechanical
running analysis assessing lower extremity kinematics,
and isometric strength tests. Following the baseline
examination, participants were instructed to maintain
their regular training habits and to report training
characteristics and potential pain on a weekly basis,
for a maximal period of 52 weeks. A more detailed
description of the study design and its methods is
published elsewhere (Jungmalm et al. 2018).

The primary outcome measure was any running-
related injury diagnosed by a medical practitioner. The
definition of RRI was slightly modified from the 2015
consensus statement by Yamato et al. (Yamato et al.
2015) and defined as:
a running-related musculoskeletal pain in the lower
limbs or back that causes a restriction on or stop-
page of running (distance, speed, duration or train-
ing) in more than 66% of all training sessions in two
consecutive weeks or in more than 50% of all train-
ing sessions in four consecutive weeks, or that re-
quires the runner to consult a physician or other
health professional.
The modification of the original definition was adopted
from a previous study (Hein et al. 2014) and due to that rec-
reational runners do not necessarily schedule their training
sessions in advance, which the original definition assumes. 
The exposure variables were biomechanical and clin-
ical/anthropometrical variables. Biomechanical variables
consisted of lower extremity kinematics (movement) and
strength measures which were measured on continuous
scales. The clinical/anthropometrical variables consisted
of measures of joint range of motion, muscle flexibility,
and trigger points measured on categorical scales. Move-
ment variables were hip adduction range of motion
(HADROM
), hip adduction velocity (HADVEL
), timing of
maximal hip adduction (HADTIM
), knee flexion range of
motion (KFROM
),  maximal joint excursion knee flexion
(KFJMAX
), knee flexion velocity (KFVEL
), timing of max-
imal knee flexion (KFTIM
),  rear foot eversion range of
motion (REVROM
), rear foot eversion velocity (REVVEL
),
timing of maximal rear foot eversion (REVTIM
),  ankle
dorsal flexion range of motion (ADFROM
),  timing of
maximal ankle dorsal flexion (ADFTIM
), and ankle touch
down angle (ATD
).  Movement variables were collected
using a 16-camera 3D motion-capture system (Qualisys
Page 4
Jungmalm et al. Injury Epidemiology (2020) 7:10  Page 4 of 9
AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) with a sampling frequency of
400 Hz, while participants ran over ground at a con-
trolled speed of 3.33 m/s (±5%) with a set of retro-
reflexive markers applied according to the ISB recom-
mendations (Wu et al. 2002). Ten strides for each side
were collected and analysed through custom-written
MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) code, and re-
ported as averages. Strength variables were isometric
maximal voluntary strength measures (MVC) and ratios
between agonistic and antagonistic muscle groups. The
following strength measures were assessed: unilateral
knee extension (KEMVC
) and flexion (KFMVC
),  bilateral
hip abduction (HABMVC
) and adduction (HADMVC
), left
and right trunk rotation (ROTMVC
),  trunk flexion
(TFMVC
),  and trunk extension (TEMVC
).  The following
strength ratios were calculated: knee extension/flexion
(H:Q), hip abduction/adduction (HAD:HAB), and trunk
flexion/extension (TF:TE). Strength was measured using
DAVID devices (David Health Solutions, Helsinki,
Finland) and the maximal torque (Nm) for each test was
normalized to body weight (Nm/kg).
Clinical/anthropometrical variables were measures of
joint range of motion, muscle flexibility, and trigger
points. Joint range of motion was assessed by the follow-
ing passive measures (i) at the hip: flexion (HFJROM
), ex-
tension (HEJROM
),  abduction (HABJROM
),  adduction
(HADJROM
),  internal rotation (HIRJROM
),  and external
rotation (HERJROM
);  (ii) at the knee: flexion (KFJROM
),
extension (KEJROM
); and (iii) at the ankle: dorsal flexion
(ADFJROM
),  plantar flexion (APFJROM
),  pronation (APJ-
ROM
), and supination (ASJROM
) according to the neutral-
zero method (Ryf and Weymann 1995). Muscle flexibil-
ity was assessed unilaterally for the hip flexors: rectus
femoris (RFFLEX
) and iliopsoas (ILFLEX
) with the Thomas
test, and for the hamstrings (HAMFLEX
)  with the
Straight Leg Raise (Jungmalm et al. 2018). Trigger points
(defined as a tender area in a muscle that reproduces
pain during palpation (Nix 2017)) were assessed at the
tractus iliotibialis (TITP
),  gastrocnemius (GTP
),  soleus
(STP
), piriformis (PFTP
), gluteus medius (GMTP
), tibialis
posterior (TPTP
),  and tibialis anterior (TATP
).  Partici-
pants informed the examiner whether the applied pres-
sure at the different locations was accompanied by pain
or not (Cummings and Baldry 2007).
A time-to-event analysis was conducted using days as
the time-scale, with primary analysis after 365 days. Cu-
mulative risk difference (%) was used as measure of asso-
ciation (Nielsen et al. 2016), calculated via the pseudo-
observation method, presented with 95% confidence
interval (95%CI),  and considered statistically significant
at p ≤ 0.05, and corrected for multiple testing via Bonfer-
roni. A survival curve (Kaplan-Meier estimator) was
plotted for each exposure value. Reasons for censoring
(Jungmalm et al. 2019) were lack of time and/or 
motivation, illness, issues with training log, pregnancy,
and other personal concerns hindering further participa-
tion, or RRI to the opposite leg. A shared frailty ap-
proach was used and the unit of interest was legs,
meaning that each runner could have different categori-
zations across the two legs. Biomechanical and clinical/
anthropometrical factors can be assumed to represent a
characteristic of a leg; therefore legs could be used as
the unit of analysis. A 68% prediction limit was used for
all movement- and strength-related exposure variables,
dividing each leg into one of three groups for each vari-
able. The approach of using a 68% prediction limit has
previously been discussed (Bahr and Holme 2003) but
sparsely used within sports injury literature (Nilsson
et al. 2012).  To our knowledge, no cut-off values have
been presented to differentiate biomechanical measures
and to categorize participants into subgroups. Therefore,
the cut-off values were defined as ±1 standard deviation
(SD) from the mean, where values outside of that range
were considered below or above the reference group, re-
spectively. In terms of joint range of motion, legs outside
the reference range were either assessed as hypo- or
hypermobile. Only two groups were defined for exposure
variables related to muscle flexibility and trigger points,
since measures were dichotomized into non-restricted/
restricted and no pain/pain, respectively. All analyses
were performed using Stata® (StataCorp. College Station,
TX).
Results
Overall, the sample consisted of 448 legs (224 runners of
which 39.6% were female).  Participants had a median
age of 41 years (interquartile range (IQR) =35–47),  an
average BMI of 22.7 kg/m2 (SD = ±2.1), 10 years of run-
ning experience (IQR = 5.3–17), and had covered 25 km
on a weekly average the previous year (IQR = 20–39).
Forty point nine percent of the sample had never experi-
enced an RRI before. The median inclusion time (time
to censoring or injury) to was 190 days (IQR = 69–361).
The cumulative injury incidence proportion for legs
was 29.0% (95%CI = 24.0%; 34.8%). The total number of
injured legs was 85. Of these, 38 injuries occurred only
at the right side and 27 injuries occurred only at the left
side, while the remaining 20 injuries were bilateral injur-
ies occurring in 10 participants. One runner was ex-
cluded prior to the analyses, since the injury occurred at
time point 367. Eventually, 448 legs were included in the
analyses. Fifty legs were censored at time point 365, and
313 legs were censored prior to that according to any
reason stated in the methods section. The results from
the primary analyses are presented in Table 1 (biomech-
anical variables) and in Table 2 (clinical/anthropometri-
cal variables),  and graphically plotted in the
supplementary material (Additional files 1 and 2).

For movement variables, the only statistically signifi-
cant characteristic found was timing of maximal ever-
sion (REVTIM
),  where runners in the +1SD-group
(having relatively late timing) sustained more injuries
than the reference group (RD = 20.7, 95%CI = 1.3; 40.0). 
For strength variables, the only statistically significant
characteristic found was a low HAB:HAD ratio. Runners
with weak abductors in relation to the adductors sus-
tained more RRI compared with runners in the reference
group (RD = 17.3, 95%CI = 0.8; 33.7).

Measures from joint range of motion, muscle flexibility
and trigger point tests did not reveal any significant dif-
ferences between exposure groups. Consequently, the
data from this study suggest no associations at all be-
tween excessive or restricted joint range of motion, ex-
cessive or restricted muscle flexibility or having painful
trigger points, and RRI.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to exploratively investi-
gate whether runners with certain biomechanical or clin-
ical/anthropometrical characteristics sustain more RRI
than runners having other biomechanical or clinical/
anthropometrical characteristics. Overall, the cumulative
incidence proportion of RRI reported in this study ap-
pears to be comparable with what previous studies have
reported (Yamato et al. 2015). However, it is important
to highlight that this study reported the incidence pro-
portion for injured legs and not for injured participants.
The finding of the association between a relatively late
timing of ankle eversion and RRI might be an indication
of insufficient neuromuscular activation of tibialis pos-
terior, since this muscle work eccentrically during the
pronation movement. However, the evidence on the as-
sociation between lower-leg kinematics, specifically
ankle eversion, and RRI is conflicting (Ceyssens et al.
2019; Munteanu and Barton 2011) and must be taken
with caution. Runners having low eversion ROM
(REVROM
)  and runners with high eversion velocity
(REVVEL
) seem to sustain more injuries than runners
within the corresponding reference groups. Taken to-
gether, runners, clinicians, and coaches should be aware
of, and pay extra attention to subgroups of runners with
certain movement characteristics – such as runners with
a relatively late timing of ankle eversion – as they may
be more susceptible to RRI.
In addition to runners having a low HAB:HAD ratio,
runners with low knee extension strength (KEMVC
)
showed a tendency towards sustaining more injuries
than runners in the reference group (RD = 17.5, 95%CI =
-1.0; 36.1).  Weak hip abductors and weak knee exten-
sors have previously been discussed as key factors in the
development of RRI, especially hip and knee injuries
(Powers 2010). The present study supports that runners
with weak hip abductors and potentially runners with
weak knee extensors sustain more injuries than those
with relatively greater strength.
Runners with decreased mobility for hip external rota-
tion and increased mobility for knee extension showed a
tendency to sustain more injuries than runners in the
corresponding reference group. A reason for the uncer-
tainty regarding hip external rotation is that only 16 legs
were categorized into the decreased mobility-group, and
that only five injuries occurred within that group. 
None of the seven measures for trigger points appear
to suggest that runners with painful trigger points sus-
tain significantly more RRI compared with runners with-
out painful trigger points. However, we cannot
completely disregard trigger points in future studies
since it seems like runners with painful trigger points in
GTP
, STP 
or TATP
, (i.e. trigger points apparent in Gastro-
cnemius, Soleus or Tibialis Anterior) sustained more in-
juries than runners without painful trigger points. Due
to the subjective experience of pain, persons with lower
pain tolerance may have a higher tendency to report in-
juries whereas others with higher pain tolerance may do
the opposite. A clear definition of RRI is therefore neces-
sary to increase the unanimity between researchers and
runners of what an injury is, regardless of level of pain
tolerance. In future studies, measuring the actual struc-
tural damage would likely be even better. Another pos-
sible reason behind this might be that a painful trigger
point can be an early sign of a structure exposed to a
higher training load than it is prepared for. Since an in-
jury occurs when the load exceeds the load-capacity of a
specific structure (Hreljac 2005),  runners with painful
trigger points might be closer to sustaining an injury. To
the authors’  knowledge, the association between trigger
points and RRI among recreational runners has not been
investigated in previous literature.
The major strength of the present study was the com-
prehensive baseline screening and the prospective study
design. Moreover, the procedure for diagnosing RRI was
superior to the commonly-used self-report approach. A
limitation of the study was the low number of injuries,
which did not reach ten for each exposure variable. Fur-
ther, this study did not have enough power to analyse
specific RRIs in recreational runners. More participants
(and more injuries) might have allowed for competing-
risk analyses, which would have been a beneficial statis-
tical tool to target the question of what type of runners
sustain more or less specific RRIs. Competing-risk ana-
lyses would also enable the examination of patterns for
different types of injuries. It is plausible that some ex-
posure variables show conflicting associations with RRI
when all injuries are grouped together. Moreover, as we
only measured each runner once, one limitation of this
study is that we were unable to quantify changes from
baseline that possibly occurred prior to injury. A final
limitation includes the difficulty to infer specific RRI
based on running biomechanics, as shown in a recent
study (Jauhiainen et al. 2020), might not be solved by in-
corporating clinical/anthropometrical measures, but
could be an important step. Sources of potential bias in
the present study could be the use of days as the time
scale, since runners were only able to sustain an injury
on a day with a running session. However, they were
considered at risk of sustaining injury all 365 days.
Page 8
Jungmalm et al. Injury Epidemiology (2020) 7:10  Page 8 of 9
Another potential bias might be the runners’ motivation
to submit training and injury information determined
which runners continued through follow-up, since a
major reason for censoring was lack of time and/or mo-
tivation (33.6%). Other reasons for censoring were injury
to opposite leg (17.9%), illness/injury not related to run-
ning (8.3%), issues with training log (0.6%) and complet-
ing follow-up (39.7%).  Importantly, the findings from
this study can only be generalised to similar runners,
which are adult, healthy Swedish recreational runners.
Conclusion
The results from the present study add new information
regarding whether runners with certain characteristics
sustain more RRI than runners with other characteris-
tics. More injuries are likely to occur in runners with
late timing of maximal eversion or weak abductors in re-
lation to adductors. Importantly, the present study re-
port who sustain more running-related injuries than
others, but is unable to eventually inform why certain
runners sustain more injuries than others (as the study
did not investigate injury mechanisms).  Coaches and
athletes can use this information in the planning of the
(running) training, for instance to if they are more likely
to committing a training error that can explain why they
sustain injury.
