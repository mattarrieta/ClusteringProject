Opt-Out Form 
iCLK Learning Initiative
I wish to opt-out of the iCLK Learning Initiative. Based on this decision, I
understand that my child will not receive an electronic device (iPad, Chromebook, or
Laptop) for use during the current school year. 
I also understand that my child will still be responsible for​  meeting all the course
requirements for his/her grade.
