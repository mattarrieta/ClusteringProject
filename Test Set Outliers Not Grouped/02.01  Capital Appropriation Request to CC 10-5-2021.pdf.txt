From: Jennifer Pratt, Acting CFO
Date: September 29, 2021
Re: Appropriation Request in the amount of $3,882,830.00 for Various Capital Projects (off the normal CIP
cycle) 
This is an appropriation request for various capital projects being brought forward off the normal Capital
Improvement Cycle. There are three projects which include the Street Improvements to Rachel Road, Bonvini
Drive, Sax Road and Harmony Lane; Farley School Roof Replacement and the Fleet Electrification Initiative
which was recommended for FY22, but was not voted as approved by the City Council. 
Appropriation Request of $600,000 for Street Improvements to Rachel Road, Bonvini Drive, Sax Road and
Harmony Lane
Based on an engineering review of the condition of Rachel Road, Bonvini Drive, Sax Road and Harmony
Lane, the Department of Public Works (DPW) is requesting $600,000 to accept these roads as public and to
rehabilitate them to meet appropriate public road standards. The DPW recommends that the City Council
appropriates the required funding concurrent with the public acceptance of the roads. Estimated cost for a 15 year
bond at 2.9% is $131,660.00. 
Appropriation Request of $3,108,400 for Farley Building Roof Replacement 
The Farley Building roof system is in critically poor condition. In October 2020 a routine, full study and roof
scan was performed by a consultant Gale Associates. This study found multiple deficiencies all pointing to a full
system replacement. The school researched alternative funding sources such as the accelerated roof repair
program offered by the MSBA, but this project does not meet the criteria required for approval of program
funding. This project was requested by the School Department as part of their FY22 Capital Improvement
Program, but was deferred. At that time the estimated cost was $1,826,975 and due to various factors including
inflation, increase in the cost of materials and labor, inclusion of structural analysis for future solar placement, 
and repairs to the copper roofs which were not included or needed in the initial FY22 request the estimated value
to replace the roof is now $3.1M with the expected costs only increasing over time and bringing this project to a
more serious need to be addressed immediately. Estimated cost for a 15 year bond at 2.9% is $682,087.00.

Appropriation Request of $174,430 for Fleet Electrification Initiative 
This funding will support the deployment of public and fleet electric vehicle (EV) charging stations as well as the
purchase of PHEVs and/or EVs to replace four (4) existing, inefficient fleet vehicles across the city specifically in
the departments of Inspectional Services, Fire Department and the Public Works Department. The request
includes eight (8) proposed EV charging ports at the locations of City Hall/Memorial Building, Fire Headquarters
at 10 Loring Drive, and Public Works Headquarters at Western Avenue; with some of the ports being available
for public use. The city will make all efforts to attain as much funding through various grant and incentive
programs as possible to cover a portion of this project. Estimated cost for a 5 year bond at 2.9% is $13,657.00. 
This appropriation requires approval of the City Council and is on the City Council agenda for 10/05/2021. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Additional information and a draft order is included as part of the background information.

Re: Street Acceptances – September 2021
The Department of Public Works (DPW) is pleased to progress the street acceptance program. 
Roadways and streets that have not been formally accepted by the City as public roadways are not
eligible for maintenance with public funds. As previously reported to the City Council, the intent of the
current street acceptance program is to address roads that were constructed under subdivision control
and that were intended to be accepted as public roads. 
To support this effort, we respectively request that the City Council consider an agenda item during their
Council meeting on Thursday, September 23, 2021 to refer a capital request to the finance subcommittee
and consider accepting the following roads as public: Rachel Road, Bonvini Drive, Sax Road and
Harmony Lane.
Based on an engineering review of the condition of Rachel Road, Bonvini Drive, Sax Road and Harmony
Lane, the DPW is requesting $600,000 to accept these roads as public and to rehabilitate them to meet
appropriate public road standards. (Note: Capital requests for rehabilitation of Bonivini Drive, Sax Road
and Harmony Lane were deferred by the Mayor’s office in FY20 and FY22 and deferred by the City
Council in FY21).  The DPW recommends that the City Council appropriates the required funding
concurrent with the public acceptance of the roads. 
If the finance subcommittee deliberation and later City Council vote approves the capital request, then
the City Council will hold a public hearing to refer the streets to the Planning Board and vote on the
intention to layout these roads if it is in the public interest to accept the private roads as public ways, in
accordance with the provisions of the General Laws of Massachusetts Chapters 79 and 82, and Chapter
410 of the Acts of 2014 (“Chapter 410”).  Following a report by the Planning Board or after the passage of
45 days, whichever occurs first, the City Council would vote to adopt the layout of the roads. Following
the second vote, the City Council would then submit a report of the City Council to the Mayor endorsing
the street acceptances. This report will be prepared by the City Solicitor, be signed by both the City
Council and the Mayor, and be recorded with the layout plans in the Registry of Deeds. 
The DPW has advanced this program significantly over the last several years. There are a handful of
streets constructed under subdivision control that remain to be accepted. We will address these roads as
funding is available. 
Please feel free to contact the Engineering Department if anyone has any questions or concerns.

Off-Cycle Farley Roof Replacement Capital Proposal
Fiscal Year 2022
The Framingham School Department respectfully requests mid-year FY2022 capital budget
funding for the Farley Building Roof Replacement project. In anticipation of the District receiving
management, oversight, and capital investment responsibilities from MassBay, the School
Department requested a capital appropriation from the City in our FY19, FY20, and FY22
proposals to address facilities maintenance issues. During FY19 and FY20, the requests were
focused on facility renovations, and mechanical system upgrades and replacements in
anticipation of relocating all Central Office staff, The Parent information Center and various
school programs, and community initiatives to Farley. In FY22, we requested funding to replace
the failing roof to ensure continued safe operations while protecting the interior infrastructure.
Unfortunately that request was deferred, allowing for the continued deterioration of the roof
system.
The current roofing system is in poor condition. In October of 2020, a routine, full study and roof
scan was performed by Gale Associates. This study found multiple deficiencies all pointing to a
full system replacement. Deficiencies identified included portions of the roof systems holding
water, allowing moisture infiltration and reported leaks throughout the building; moisture damage
at multiple test pit locations; lack of effective slope to direct moisture to the drains resulting in
ponding water; deteriorated roofing lap seams between reinforcing plys; and the presence of
water collecting within the open flutes of the metal deck furthering damage and water infiltration.
The School Department’s roof contractor, Tremco, has performed numerous assessments and
repairs due to continued leaks and infiltration damage. Additionally, the warranties for Farley
expired in 2017 & 2018, leaving the City open to potential liabilities with the failing system and
responsible for any needed repairs.
Staff have researched alternative funding sources such as the accelerated roof repair program
offered by the MSBA. Unfortunately due to the current and future planned usage of Farley, it
does not meet the requirements of remaining a public K-12 school facility, serving public school
students, for the duration of the useful life of roof repair. This has limited our ability to submit a
statement of interest for the accelerated roof repair program, similar to how we have
approached projects at McCarthy and Dunning Elementary School’s. The current project cost is
$3,108,400, which has greatly increased over the FY22 request of $1,826,975. A number of
factors have impacted costs, leading to a large project increase. Those factors include inflation;
increase in materials and labor; inclusion of a structural analysis for future solar placement;
repairs to the copper roofs which were not included or needed in the prior year proposal; and
increase in cost per s.f. over the past fiscal year (FY22- $30/s.f.; current pricing is $38/s.f.). It is
our expectation that if this project continues to be deferred, the cost will continue to increase,
placing a large financial burden on the City.
The Farley Building plays a vital role in the District’s future vision. Starting in the summer of
2021, all central office Departments have begun relocating to the Farley Building. This includes,
Page 6
but is not limited to Adult ESL; Welcome Center; Business Operations; Superintendent’s Office;
Equity, Diversity and Community Development; Buildings & Grounds; Human Resources;
Community Resource Development; School Committee; and many other District Departments.
MassBay plans on vacating the 80,000 s.f. they currently occupy by 2023. If catastrophic failure
occurred to the roof and we were forced to vacate the building, the cost to the district to rent a
similar sized footprint (22,000 s.f.) to support operations of these Departments and programs
would cost between $440,000 to $704,000 annually to rent appropriate space. The School
Department will continue to develop plans once we determine the future use of the Farley
building in the areas currently occupied by Mass Bay. It is imperative for the City to replace the
Farley roof as soon as possible as construction costs continue to escalate and the roof
continues to deteriorate.

Executive Summary
In accordance with our contract, Gale Associates, Inc. (Gale) has prepared a roof condition survey
for the Framingham Public Schools (FPS).  This submission relates specifically to the existing
condition of the low-sloped roof areas at the Farley Middle School (FMS) located at 19 Flagg Street, 
Framingham, MA. This report includes descriptions of the existing conditions, photo
documentation, and provides roof remediation options. 
The existing roofing systems at Farley Middle School reviewed consist of multi-ply built-up roofing
assemblies installed over polyisocyanurate rigid insulation. The roof deck at the FMS was observed
to consist of sloped metal decking. Based on our observations, portions of the roof systems are
wet and allowing moisture infiltration and reported leaks. The system appears to be approaching
the end of their useful service life. 
An infrared roof scan was performed to identify areas of potential moisture damage. Based on the
extent of moisture, a potential full system replacement should be considered at the Farley Middle
School. Additional deficiencies observed include lack of effective slope to direct moisture to the
drains resulting in ponding water, deteriorated roofing lap seams between reinforcing plys, and the
presence of water collecting within the open flutes of the metal deck. 
•  Roof Areas A, G, H, I, J, L appear to exhibit the most widespread signs of moisture within the
roofing system with the potential to cause deterioration to the roofing structural deck and it is
Gale’s opinion that these roof areas should be considered for immediate removal and
replacement. 
•  Roof Area D consists of an EPDM roof system that was installed in 2016 and is currently covered
under a 20-year warranty and was not reviewed as part of this evaluation. 
Please note that the estimated cost noted below does not include any special permitting fees which
may or may not be required for this project, additional engineering fees, Framingham’s monitoring
of the project, interior renovations beyond those that are described within this report, a
construction trailer/office space, or soft costs associated with working with Framingham Public
Schools. Again, these recommended budgets are preliminary, and should not be used for sensitive
budgeting, as the final scope of work, and detailing has not been confirmed at this time. 
Estimated Remediation Cost: 
•  Full System Replacement with a Multi-ply Built-up Roofing System: $3,000,000
•  Full System Replacement with a Single-ply PVC Roofing Membrane: $2,110,000
•  Full System Replacement with a Single-ply Kee Roofing Membrane: $2,140,000
•  Replacement of the Skylight Glazing Assemblies: Approx. $50 sq.ft. = $70,000

Figure 1: Farley Middle School Roof Area Plan 
Background
The Farley Middle School reportedly constructed in 1973 and renovated in 2003 is currently leased
to the Massachusetts Bay Community College. The approximate 52,000 sq.ft., two-story building is
constructed with a concrete masonry unit (CMU) backup wall and the masonry veneer. Irregular
shaped aluminum windows, areas of wood siding, and hollow metal doors are located within the
exterior walls. The roofing consists of isolated areas of sloped metal panels, translucent skylights
with single pane glazing and a gravel surface built-up roofing assembly. 
The existing roofing systems at the FMS include low sloped and limited areas of steep sloped roofs. 
The steep sloped roofs consist of standing seam copper panel roofs installed over structural metal
decking located over stair towers and entrances. The low sloped roof systems consist of gravel
surface built-up roofing assemblies incorporating 4 plys of reinforced fabric that are set in a fluid
applied asphaltic based adhesive over a ½” fiber board coverboard and varying thickness of flat
stock polyisocyanurate insulation. The roofing system is installed on a sloped structural metal
decking. Several large Roof Top Units (RTU)s, Air Handler Units (AHU)s, and smaller air conditioners
and vents are located within the roof areas.

Visual Evaluation
As part of the evaluation, Gale conducted a visual evaluation of the FMS’s roof areas to observe the
extent and location of defects as well as locate areas of potential moisture infiltration using non-
destructive capacitance metering and infrared thermography. 
Figure 2: Farley Middle School Roof Area Plan with Infrared Images Overlayed 
Low Sloped Roofs, Roof Areas A through M
Gale’s general observations include but are not limited to the following: 
1.  The existing roof drains generally consist of no-hub cast iron assemblies that appear to be in
good condition however, they exhibit surface rust in the bowls and on drain hardware. Cast
iron strainers are generally in good condition but are dislodged from the clamping rings at
some locations.

Page 29
2.  Numerous previously performed repairs were evident based on the quantity of stripped-in
membrane seams and roof patches that were observed in the field of the roof and at roof-
to-wall flashings. The repairs appear to be in fair condition, but the presence of the stone
ballast created difficulties in confirming the extent of the repairs and condition of the patch
perimeters which are typically more susceptible to failure and allowing moisture infiltration. 
3.  A large ribbon of slope skylight assemblies is present between Roof Areas G/J and H/I. Signs
of previous repairs to the mullions of the skylight were observed. Several fastener heads
were observed to not be in full contact with the skylight frame and could provide path for
water to enter into the skylight frame. The roof areas at the base of the skylight slope were
found to wet during the test cut in this area, and water was observed collecting within the
flutes of the metal deck. 
4.  Roof flashing heights were generally observed to meet or exceed the industry recommended
standard of 8” minimum. The addition of insulation may affect limited areas around select
rooftop unit curbs. 
5.  Visible flashing membrane installed at rooftop equipment curbs appears in good condition
however, patches installed at seams and corners are delaminated. 
6.  Results of the roof infrared (IR) thermographic survey revealed areas of potential wet
insulation at the following locations: 
a. Along the north and south edges of Roof Area A. 
b. The southern portion of Roof Area E. 
c. A significant portion of Roof Areas G, H, I, J. Most notably were areas where roof repairs
had previously been preformed as well as along the length of the low side of the skylight
assembly. 
d. The southern portion of Roof Area L. 
e. Due to access restrictions, Gale did not review the existing conditions at Roof Areas B and
M but based on the infrared images and Gale’s observations at similar roofing condition
areas of limited moisture are anticipated to exist on these roof areas. 
Destructive Testing
Following the infrared scan of the roof that was performed to confirm the findings of the infrared
roof scan. On Wednesday, September 9, 2020, a representative from Gale coordinated with
Greenwood Industries, Inc. (Greenwood) to perform destructive test cuts to determine existing
conditions at select areas of the low sloped roofs. Test cuts were performed in areas suspected to
contain moisture based on the infrared scan. In total, thirteen (13) test cuts, most of which were
approximately 6” square in size, were performed on the existing low sloped roof systems. Test cut
locations were patched by Greenwood following Gale’s review of the test cut locations. Please note
that the test cuts we observed were representative, and not indicative of each condition that may
exist on the building. Refer to the following roof plan for approximate test cut locations, Figure 3.

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
New construction, as well as repair and alteration of existing buildings in Massachusetts, is
regulated by 780 CMR, Massachusetts State Building Code (MSBC), and 521 CMR, The Architectural
Access Board (AAB).  The code review was based on the proposed renovations being constructed
under the 9th Edition of the MSBC which is based upon the International Building Code 2015 (IBC) 
and the Massachusetts Amendments. The 9th Edition is reportedly based upon the 2015 versions
of the International Building Code (IBC),  International Existing Building Code (IEBC),  2018
International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), and along with Massachusetts Amendments. 
Under the 9th Edition of the MSBC Chapter 34 Existing Structures refers to the International Existing
Building Code 2015 (IEBC) as modified by the Massachusetts Amendments. This section of the code
applies when there are repairs, alterations, additions or a change in use to existing buildings and
generally refers to other sections of 780 CMR for specific requirements. Alterations to existing
buildings including the removal and replacement of building elements with a continuation of the
same use group (as is the case for the roof replacement at the FHS) are governed by Chapter 6, 
Alterations – Level 1: 
6
Page 32
•  Section 602: Building Elements and Materials – Generally, existing buildings must be
modified in a manner that does not decrease safety. 
•  Section 603: Fire Protection – At this time, Gale does not anticipate any modifications to
the existing fire protection system. 
•  Section 604: Means of Egress – It is Gale’s understanding that the building is fully compliant
with egress requirements. No modifications to egress components are anticipated. 
•  Section 605: Accessibility – Gale recommends that FPS confirm that the building conforms
with the MAAB requirements or perform a compliance study. 
Based on the current scope of work and anticipated costs, FPS should confirm that the
renovations not exceed 30% of the full and fair cash value of the facility and will not require
additional accessibility improvements. As the project will exceed $500,000, a minimum
accessible entrance and bathroom will be required if not already present. Gale
recommends that FPS confirm that the building conforms with the MAAB requirements or
perform a compliance study. 
•  Section 606: Structural – This section of the code outlines requirements of the alterations
of work where reroofing is required. As part of the evaluation of the existing roofing system, 
Gale completed a gravity load code review of the existing FHS building’s roof framing in
accordance with Chapter 34: Existing Structures, of 780 CMR, the MSBC. Based on our
review and calculations, the following is a summary of our findings: 
•  As this building appears to be Seismic Design Category B, it is Gale’s opinion this
section of the code does not apply for this project. 
•  Because the basic wind speed for the City of Framingham is 130 mph and the building
appear to be classified as Occupancy Category III, this section of the code does not
appear to apply for this project. 
•  The proposed replacement at FMS building is not anticipated to increase the roof dead
and live load capacity more than 5%.
Due the presence of stone ballast and the potential for displacing stones down the drain, Gale was
not able to confirm the exact sizes and locations of all roof drains and therefore was not able to
confirm the capacity of the existing roof drainage system. However, based on our visual
observations, the existing roof drains of the low slope roof areas appear to provide adequate
drainage, but evidence of ponding water suggests that low lying areas are collecting and retaining
moisture following rain events. A full review of the existing drainage to confirm the capacity of the
existing roof drainage system for compliance with the Massachusetts State Plumbing Code (MSPC) 
should be performed during the design phase of the roof replacement. Additional crickets should
be provided to facilitate drainage from low areas. Secondary overflow drainage may be
recommended at some locations.

DISCUSSION AND OPINIONS
Based on our evaluation of the low sloped roofs, reported leaks, and water observed in the roof
system it is Gale’s opinion that the existing built-up roof assemblies is approaching the end of its
useful service life. The Owner can select to preserve portions of the roofing but based on the
system configuration lacking proper air/vapor barrier components and system transitions, 
continued deterioration of the underlaying system components can affect the overall performance
of the roofing assembly. 
Low Sloped Roof Systems
Based on the observed conditions noted previously, there are five (5) types of roof coverings which
could be considered for the low-slope replacement roof systems at this facility. Each system has its
own chemical and physical properties and proven performance characteristics. Refer to the
appropriate building section for discussions of unique conditions, and how they may affect the final
design recommendations. These membrane systems are as follows: 
1.  Gravel Surfaced Built-Up Roofing (GSBUR) membranes are alternating layers of asphalt, 
reinforcing felts (organic or non-organic) and gravel surfacing similar to the current roof
system. Of the systems discussed herein for low slope applications, the GSBUR is the most
time proven. Properly designed and installed, these systems have shown good longevity. 
GSBUR systems are field fabricated and therefore, considered more workmanship
dependent, and can be susceptible to problems during construction. GSBUR can be applied
with hot asphalt or cold mastics. Hot applied systems are accompanied by the odor of
asphalt and use of 450°F to 500°F asphalt on the roof. The asphalt acts as the waterproofing
materials while the fabric and felts provide the strength. Hot asphalt used to install the
system can have logistic implications due to the strong fumes associated with the asphalt
and the possibility of a fire hazard created by the asphalt kettle application. “Cold-process” 
built-up systems avoid temperature application of asphalt, and as such, have less odor. The
cold process systems offer superior resistance to vandalism but can be difficult to repair. 
Manufacturers of this type of system offer 10-20 and sometimes 30-year material and
workmanship warrantees. 
2.  Styrene – Butadiene – Styrene Granular Surfaced Modified-Bitumen Roof Membranes (SBS) 
are field fabricated and installed in multi-ply (minimum of two) configurations. SBS
membranes can be set in hot asphalt or cold adhesive, or they can be torch applied. With its
thick, puncture resistant, granular surfaced cap sheet, SBS exhibits excellent puncture and
impact resistance similar to the BUR systems. As with cold and hot applied BUR systems, 
modified-bitumen membranes are workmanship dependent and can be susceptible to
problems during construction for contractors not proficient with the installation
requirements. Hot applied systems are accompanied by the odor of asphalt and use of 450°F
to 500°F asphalt on the roof. The asphalt acts as the waterproofing material while the plies
provide the strength. Hot asphalt used to install the system can have logistic implications
due to the strong fumes associated with the asphalt and the possibility of a fire hazard
created by the asphalt kettle or torch application. Cold process systems avoid temperature
application of asphalt, and as such, have less odor and would be a good alternative for this
site. The manufacturers of SBS membrane systems offer 15-20 year and sometimes 30-year
8
Page 34
material and workmanship warranties that are similar with other membrane system
manufacturers. 
3.  Elastomeric Roof Membranes (EPDM - Ethylene Propylene Diene Terpolymer) are single-ply
synthetic rubber membranes which can be installed as a fully adhered or mechanically
attached system. EPDM roof coverings are field fabricated with the seams of the membrane
adhered with adhesive or a two-sided adhesive seam tape. The adhered membrane seams
require specific preparation work to conform to the manufacturer’s requirements. It has
been Gale’s experience that the seams of EPDM systems are prone to delamination within
the warranty period and unless leaks occur, are not repaired under warranty. Proper slope
to drain is required to effectively remove water from the membrane surface and is critical
for extended surface life and warranty coverages. Some EPDM warranties have specific
limitations excluding ponded water as a result of seam adhesive degeneration when exposed
to prolonged moisture. EPDM sheets are prefabricated off-site in the manufacturer’s plants
by making large sheets of membrane that are installed in “panels” on the site. Each of these
panels are then adhered together using the bonding adhesives or pre-manufactured tapes
to provide a watertight roof. These systems have a lower puncture resistance compared to
the SBS, but their repairability is good and can easily be performed by certified maintenance
personnel. 
Gale is aware of 15-year-old EPDM systems which are currently performing satisfactorily. 
However, it is Gale’s experience that after seven to ten years, maintenance in the form of
seam repairs will be required. Manufacturers of this type of system typically offer 10 to 20-
year materials and workmanship warranties and have recently promoted thicker membranes
that carry a 30-year warranty. Gale would recommend stripping-in all field fabricated seams
if EPDM is specified, as well as designing for complete removal of all water through proper
slope to drain (i.e. additional tapered insulation).
4.  Single-ply thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) roof membranes are also single-ply membranes
that are available from several manufacturers. TPO membranes are manufactured in wide
rolls similar to that of the EPDM sheets and can be adhered with a bonding adhesive, or in
some cases with a self-adhesive backing, to the insulation system. TPO membrane seams
are thermally fused (hot air welded or in some cases solvent welded depending on the
manufacturer’s requirements) to form a monolithic sheet that does not rely on adhesives for
a watertight bond. Warranties that are competitive with SBS and EPDM systems are
available. TPO warranties do not typically contain a ponded water exclusion as a result of
the thermally fused seams. Similar to the EPDM systems, the puncture resistance of the TPO
membrane is lower than that of SBS. It should be noted that repairs to TPO membrane can
often be difficult as the top surface of the membrane ages, making future welding
problematic. Also, there are multiple manufacturers of TPO systems, with multiple
formulations and differing material characteristics. These different characteristics do not
allow for accurate monitoring of the product’s track record. It should also be noted that
there have been several reports of premature aging and failures of TPO systems, which is
assumed to be a direct result of modifying the formulations in an attempt to modify the final
roofing product. Should TPO’s be considered, additional walkway pads should be used as
the membrane becomes very slippery when exposed to accumulated precipitation. 
9
Page 35
5.  Single-ply thermoplastic (polyvinyl chloride – PVC, or Elvaloy based) roof membranes are
another option. PVC/Elvaloy membrane systems are available from several manufacturers. 
Based on our experience, it is Gale’s opinion that the reinforced coated systems offer
satisfactory chemical/physical properties. PVC/Elvaloy membranes can be installed as a fully
adhered, mechanically attached or a loose laid and ballasted application. Similar to the
EPDM and TPO membranes, the PVC/Elvaloy membrane is manufactured in wide rolls. 
However, the PVC/Elvaloy membrane seams are thermally fused by hot air welds only to
form a monolithic sheet that does not rely on adhesives for a watertight bond. Warranties
that are competitive with GSBUR and EPDM systems are available. PVC/Elvaloy warranties
do not typically contain a ponded water exclusion as a result of the thermally fused seams. 
Similar to the EPDM systems, the puncture resistance of the PVC/Elvaloy membrane is lower
than that of SBS but is easy to repair using handheld heat welding equipment. Gale is aware
of several membrane assemblies in New England which have been performing successfully
for over 20 years. There are European installations of these products reported to be in excess
of 25 years old. Similar to the TPO system, additional walkway pads should be considered
on this membrane as it becomes very slippery when wet. 
Coverboards
As standard polyisocyanurate insulation systems are typically susceptible to puncture from falling
objects, can be crushed if uneven weight is applied, or can allow sharp objects such as tools to
damage the roof membranes proposed, Gale recommends that a dense coverboard be utilized
between the polyisocyanurate and roof membrane components. This coverboard can vary from
manufacturer and roof system, but would either be a moisture resistant gypsum board such as that
manufactured by Georgia-Pacific, a high density isocyanurate as supplied by several single ply
manufactures, or a wood fiberboard insulation as required by the manufacturers of GSBUR or SBS
systems. 
It is however the experience of this office that the moisture resistant gypsum and fiberboard
coverboards are more susceptible to moisture accumulation over long periods of time should water
infiltration or vapor drive issues occur under the roof membrane. Therefore, Gale recommends
that a high density, polyisocyanurate insulation be fully adhered over the attached roof insulation
system to provide a more durable substrate for the roof membrane, as well as reduce the potential
of damage to the roof membrane as a result of potential fastener back-out should the fasteners be
in direct contact with the roof membrane. Some additional review of these products may be
required during the design phase to confirm the intent of the installation requirements. 
Insulation 
There are several types of roof insulation boards that may be considered suitable for application
on these roofs. In a conventional, insulated roof system, only polyisocyanurate insulation has a
higher thermal resistance (R-Value) per inch requiring much less overall insulation thicknesses over
its competitors. Due to the existing positive slope of the roof deck, the use of flat stock insulation
should be considered. The greater thicknesses of insulation may result in additional wood blocking
and raising rooftop equipment to accommodate flashing heights. 
10
Page 36
As referenced, long-term repairs would include the removal and replacement of the existing roof
assemblies down to the roof deck. Replacement would consist of new roof assembly components
that includes, but is not limited to, multiply built-up roof waterproofing, high density insulation
coverboard, rigid flat and tapered insulation, and vapor barrier (VB) membrane, over a base layer
of insulation on top of the existing steel deck. It is Gale’s opinion that an adhered VB membrane
be installed that ties-in to the exterior wall system’s vapor barrier if there is one in place. Roof
replacement would also include new membrane and sheet metal flashings along the perimeter and
around rooftop penetrations. It is Gale’s opinion that throughwall flashings at rising masonry walls
would not need to be replaced but several low rising walls could be clad with roofing to address
potentially low flashing heights due to added tapered insulation. Based on the age of the drains, 
FPS should consider replacement of drain assemblies in conjunction with the roof replacement.

PHOTOS
Photo 1 – The initial appearance of the existing conditions at the
Farley Middle School Building appear to indicate a reasonably
sound roofing system. The presence of stone ballast reduces the
ability to identify deficiencies through visual evaluation alone. 
Photo 2 – Through the use of unmanned areal drones equipped
with infrared camera technology, Gale identified several areas
with the potential of containing moisture within the roofing
assembly. 
Photo 3 – In conjunction with the infrared roof scan, Gale utilized
capacitance testing to determine the locations of test cuts. 
Photo 4 – Thirteen (13) individual test cut locations were selected
based on the gather data. In general, the roofing system at the test
locations consists of a gravel surface built-up roofing membrane
installed over a fiberboard coverboard, Polyiso rigid insulation and
a sloped metal deck. 
Page 39
Photo 5 – The presence of moisture within the roofing system
components was confirmed with the use of moisture sensitive
test strips. Varying levels of moisture were observed at each of
the test locations where moisture was found. 
Photo 6 – Varying levels of moisture were observed within the
roofing system components at select locations .
Photo 7 – Standing water was observed to be collecting within
the flutes of the corrugated roof deck in select locations. 
Photo 8 – In general, the skylight assembly appears to be in fair
condition, but Gale observed that several fasteners do not appear
to fully engage the mullion covers. The conditions could
potentially provide a path for water to enter the building and
roofing assembly.

Framingham Fleet Efficiency Analysis
FEBRUARY 2021 
Prepared for the City of Framingham
Prepared by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council
Funded by the MA Department of Energy Resources
Introduction
This memo covers the results of the Fuel Efficiency Analysis completed for the City of Framingham by the
Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) during the summer and fall of 2020. Funded by the
Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources’ (DOER) Regional Energy Planning Assistance (REPA) 
program, MAPC conducted analysis of the City’s vehicle inventory, identified priority areas for analysis of
replacement with electric or fuel-efficient options, and developed recommendations for future
replacements. 
Analysis for the fleet efficiency study is based on the City’s vehicle inventory as of August 2020. When
available, City staff provided MAPC with data on each vehicle’s annual gallons of gasoline or diesel
consumed and miles driven for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19). This data was used to calculate average miles per
gallon (MPG) for each vehicle. Trailers, mobile vehicles, and motorcycles were excluded from the analysis. 
All analysis was completed using the publicly available Alternative Fuel Life-Cycle Environmental and
Economic Transportation (AFLEET) Tool developed by Argonne National Laboratory.[URL: "#Page71"] 1 MAPC used the 2019
version of AFLEET. 
Understanding Framingham’s Vehicle Fleet 
The City fleet’s consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel accounts for nearly 30% of the City’s total energy
consumption on an annual basis. As a designated Green Community, implementing measures to reduce the
fleet’s energy consumption is important strategy toward achieving the City’s 20 percent energy reduction
goal. Fuel efficiency measures and vehicle electrification can also bring along significant operational cost
savings for Departments, particularly when high mileage and low efficiency vehicles are strategically
targeted for replacement. 
As of August 2020, the City’s vehicle fleet is made up of 349 vehicles from 13 City Departments. 
Department of Public Works (DPW) vehicles made up nearly half of the vehicle fleet, while the Police, Fire, 
Parks, and School Department vehicles made up a majority of the other half of the fleet (See Figure 1).
Vehicle age (i.e., model year) across the fleet spans three decades, with a majority of fleet vehicles
between model years 2012 and 2020 (See Figure 2). A large number of vehicles were also purchased in
the 2008 model year. 
City staff were able to provide annual fuel consumption and mileage for 207 of the 349 vehicles (vehicles
missing vehicle specific data are primarily made up of police cruisers from the Police Department and

An examination of a specific vehicle’s drive cycle is necessary to understand the potential for energy and
cost savings potential. However, there are some high-level characteristics that can be identified from the
departmental analysis provided in Table 1. DPW vehicles by far log the most annual vehicle miles driven
of any City department and have one of the lowest average calculated miles per gallon (MPG) across the
departments. The low fuel efficiency rating is likely attributable to the characteristics of predominant
vehicle classes of the DPW vehicles (i.e., medium, heavy, and extra heavy-duty trucks). While there are not
currently a wide array of electric or hybrid options for these vehicle classes, the market is quickly evolving
and this segment of the City’s fleet represents a significant opportunity for cost and energy savings when
those options become commercially practicable. This same recommendation applies for many of the School
and Fire Department vehicles that also log high annual mileage per vehicle, with low average fuel
efficiency ratings. 
The remaining departments on average report relatively low annual mileage numbers, which will impact
the payback periods for replacement of these vehicles and the scale of impact upgrades in fuel economy
will have on operating costs and energy savings. The remainder of this memo goes into detail on
replacement calculations for four key opportunity areas within the City’s fleet. 
Opportunity Area Analysis
Sedan and SUV Analysis and Recommendations
There are 14 sedans and 25 SUVs within the City’s vehicle fleet incorporated in this analysis. Sedans are
spread across the DPW Engineering and Highway Divisions and Health, Inspections, Fire, and Capital
Projects and Facilities Management (CPFM) Departments. SUVs are primarily within the Fire Department, 
Inspections Department and DPW Divisions (Engineering, Streetlights, Wastewater, Sanitation, and Water).
Sedans
Sedans included in this analysis consumed 3,460 gallons of gasoline in FY19. Across nearly all vehicles, the
sedan fleet has calculated MPG ratings (i.e., those based on actual gallons consumed) that are 12 to 67
percent less efficient than the rated combined MPG listed on FuelEconomy.gov, suggesting that many of
FRAMINGHAM FLEET EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS FEBRUARY 2021  3
Page 74
these vehicles may be idling for a portion of the day thereby reducing their overall fuel efficiency. Vehicle
age ranges from 2008 to 2016 – making all of the sedans potential candidates for replacement in the
next one to five years (if assuming a vehicle life span of 10 to 12 years). However, a portion of the sedan
fleet (primarily the Health Department vehicles) are very low mileage – which can challenge the economics
of replacement with more costly battery electric vehicles. 
Vehicle Electrification Scenarios
Simple payback analysis in AFLEET for the sedan fleet is based on replacement of the existing gasoline
fueled sedans with 2020 Nissan Leafs (with a 62-kW battery). For both sedan electrification scenarios, 
vehicles #157 (Highway Division, high mileage outlier) and #426 (Health Department, hybrid electric) are
removed from the calculation to avoid skewing the data.

In Scenario #1, where all 12 sedans are replaced with battery electric vehicles, the simple payback is
19.2 years. In Scenario #2, we analyzed the replacement of only the five highest mileage sedans to
improve the payback period, while still excluding the outlier vehicles of #157 and #426. The vehicles
included for replacement are two Inspections Division, one Capital Projects and Facilities Management, and
two Engineering Division sedans. In Scenario #2, the simple payback is reduced to 7.4 years, which means
the vehicles will provide operational savings towards the second half of the vehicle’s lifespan. This suggests
a general rule of thumb to identify a cost-effective electrification opportunity for sedan’s in the city’s fleet
would be to target any sedan that drives more than 3,500 miles annually and has a calculated fuel
efficiency rating at or under 16 MPG.

Vehicle Electrification with Fleet Right-Sizing Scenario
Another way to improve the overall efficiency of a fleet and improve payback period of vehicle
replacements is through right-sizing. This approach involves examining the daily use patterns of existing
low-mileage vehicles to see if there are opportunities to consolidate use of multiple vehicles down to a
single vehicle that may be shared by multiple drivers. It is important that any right-sizing be done in
consultation with fleet managers and drivers to ensure it is appropriate and meets their operational needs. 
In Scenario #3, we illustrate the potential impact of a right-sizing approach paired with electrification by
consolidating four of the Engineering Department vehicles down to two vehicles to increase usage of each
vehicle (for the calculation, we assume a new average annual mileage of 4,500). For this scenario, we also
remove all of the Health Department and Fire Department sedans that have annual mileage too low to
have significant cost or energy savings.

In Scenario #3, the fleet is now saving on both acquisition costs and has projected operational savings of
over $2,000 annually. This illustrates how increasing utilization of fleet vehicles and strategically
electrifying high usage vehicles can provide significant cost savings for the municipality.

Recommendations
•  Replace DPW Highway Vehicle #157 and Inspections Vehicles #49 and #53 with full battery
electric options in the next 1-3 years. Consider replacing CPFM Vehicle #412 and DPW
Engineering Vehicles #138 and #147 with full battery electric options in the next 3-6 years. 
•  Target fuel inefficient sedans within the fleet that drive, on average, over 3,500 miles per year
for replacement with full battery electric options. 
•  Discuss fleet right-sizing and pool vehicle options with the DPW Engineering Division to make
replacement of the vehicles with full battery electric options more financially viable. 
FRAMINGHAM FLEET EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS FEBRUARY 2021  5

SUVs
SUVs included in this analysis consumed 9,041 gallons of gasoline in FY19. Overall, the SUVs have higher
mileage and lower MPGs than the Sedan vehicle fleet, presenting an opportunity for higher cost and
energy savings. SUV age ranges from 2004 to 2017. For the purposes of comparing like to like, this
analysis separates the compact SUV fleet (Ford Escapes) from the full-size SUV fleet (Ford Explorers).
Simple Payback analysis in AFLEET is based on replacement of the existing vehicles with either a 2020
Ford Hybrid Escape, a 2020 Ford Hybrid Explorer, or a 2021 Hyundai KONA Electric (SEL trim). There is
not currently a Hyundai dealership on the statewide contract so the City may need to execute its own
procurement for this new model of vehicle. 
Compact SUV Replacement Scenarios
The seven gasoline Ford Escapes in the fleet average 3,207 miles a year with an average MPG of 16.5. 
This is the lower mileage, higher MPG segment of the City’s SUV fleet.

When replaced with hybrid electric vehicles in Scenario #1, the simple payback is 2.1 years. In Scenario
#2, we replace the Ford Escapes with Hyundai KONA Electric. This results in a simple payback of 28.7
years due to the much higher MSRP for this new battery electric SUV in comparison to the compact hybrid
electric SUV.

The current hybrid replacement option for the Ford Explorer has a high cost difference from the base
gasoline model. Even though it provides a substantial improvement in fuel economy for these higher
mileage SUVs, the simple payback is 24 years as is shown in Scenario #1. 
In Scenario #2, we explore the cost and energy savings impact of reducing the vehicle size from full-size
SUV Explorers to compact SUV Escapes. This results in significant energy savings and immediate cost
savings for the City. In Scenario #3, we explore the potential of replacing the Ford Explorers with Hyundai
KONA Electric subcompact SUVs, which will have greater environmental and operational savings impact
than the hybrid electric option. In this scenario with the all-electric SUVs, the fleet will see the highest
operating savings in comparison to the existing gasoline SUV fleet and a simple payback of 2.7 years.

Recommendations
•  Replace the seven Ford Escapes with hybrid electric models. Starting with Engineering Division
vehicles #145 and #146 (oldest).
FRAMINGHAM FLEET EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS FEBRUARY 2021  7
Page 78
•  Discuss with Engineering Division, Fire Department, and Inspections Department whether the
technical specs of Hyundai KONA Electric, or comparable all-electric SUV, will meet drivers needs
as replacements for the Ford Explorer SUVs. 
•  Target replacement of the full-size SUVs that have an annual mileage over 5,000 miles with an
all-electric SUV option, such as the Hyundai KONA or other models as they become available. 
Light Duty Pick-Ups Analysis and Recommendations
Light duty pick-ups consumed 23,756 gallons of gasoline and 335 gallons of diesel in FY19. Vehicle ages
range from 2006 to 2019. Battery electric options to replace light duty pick-ups, such as F-150s, are
imminently emerging onto the market. In the interim, one option to explore is the XLP Plug-in Hybrid Electric
Drive up-fit system. When considering vehicles for up-fit, the City should target the oldest vehicles that are
nearing the end of their operations.

*UP-FIT AND VEHICLE PRICING AND MPG IS BASED ON PRICING FROM STATEWIDE CONTRACTS VEH102 AND
VEH98, AS WELL AS PRODUCT CUT SHEETS FROM XL. 
AFLEET Payback Analysis is based on replacement with 2020 F-150 and F250 that have been up-fit with
the XLP system. XL reports a fuel economy improvement of up to 50% for its XLP system. The analysis
applies this improvement in fuel economy to the existing fleet’s MPG. We are assuming a base price of
$35,730 for the F-150 and $40,135. XLP system cost estimate is $26,760 for an F-150 and $27,300 for
an F-250. 
For both the F150 and F250, the simple payback period is lengthy and well beyond the anticipated
lifespan of the vehicles. However, the payback period for the F250 up-fit (18.1 years) is less than half the
payback period for the F150 up-fit (46.2 years). This suggests that this technology may be a more
impactful solution for the F250s, particularly if grant funding is leveraged to subsidize the additional cost
of the up-fit.

Recommendations
•  Conduct additional analysis using the AFLEET Tool when pricing and fuel economy information is
released by Ford regarding the electric F150 to identify if more cost-effective than the XLP up-fit
option tested in this memo. 
•  Consider applying for Green Communities grant funding in 2021 to pilot the XLP up-fit on 1 to 2
F250 pickups within the City’s fleet that are due for replacement. Move forward with installation
of charging infrastructure if needed at the vehicle’s primary parking site. 
Police Cruiser Idling Analysis and Recommendations
The Police Department fleet is relatively young in comparison to other City Departments – a majority of
the vehicles were purchased in the last five model years (2016 to 2020). Other vehicle ages range from
2006 to 2015. The most common make and model in the fleet is the Ford Police Interceptor Explorer – this
analysis examines options for improving the fuel economy of the 45 existing Ford Police Interceptor
Explorers. The average lifetime of a police cruiser in the City’s fleet is 6 years (about 3 years of front-line
service and 3 years in a secondary role).
Actual mileage for each police cruiser was not available at the time of this analysis, so several assumptions
and estimates needed to be made: 
•  Existing fleet was assumed to have an annual driven mileage of 12,500 miles with 600 hours of
idling annually. 
•  MPG ratings for police cruisers are unavailable on FuelEconomy.gov so data available from
 fuelly.com was used as a proxy for MPG. Existing fleet was assumed to have an average MPG of
14.6. 
•  Exact pricing for the 2021 Ford Police Interceptor Hybrid with all necessary up-fits required by
the Police Department was not available. However, the base MSRP of the hybrid model is
comparable to the gasoline model, so a slightly higher purchase price was assumed based on the
purchase prices listed in the City’s inventory ($52,000).
•  For the idle reduction calculations, the default assumptions provided in AFLEET were used for the
breakdown of services required, fuel consumption rates, electrical power demand, and idle
reduction equipment price. 
Hybrid Electric Cruiser Replacement Scenario
The first option examined for the police cruisers was replacement with the 2021 Ford Police Interceptor
Hybrid.

Based on the assumptions listed above, the simple payback analysis in AFLEET shows a pay back of just
over a year (1.3). This output is heavily reliant on the cost estimates used and the MPG of the existing
fleet. Further investigation of the actual MPG of the cruisers will better determine whether this is a cost-
effective option. If the price of the hybrid option with all up-fits is within a reasonable range of its gasoline

counterpart, a schedule of replacing these vehicles as they come of age is a sensible approach given the
cost savings potential and emissions benefits.

Idle Reduction Technology Scenario
The second option examined for the police cruisers was the installation of idle reduction technology during
the up-fit process when new acquisitions are made to replace the existing fleet vehicles. For the AFLEET
idling analysis we tested out the potential savings from installing a battery auxiliary power unit paired
with a fuel operated air heater. The Idle Reduction calculator produced a simple payback of 13.9 years. 
This may be a viable alternative depending on the final economics of the hybrid vehicles in the first
scenario.

Recommendations
•  Work with the Police Department to spec out the up-fit pricing for a standard gasoline and a
hybrid 2021 Ford Police Interceptor to verify the savings potential identified above. 
•  Commit to purchasing the hybrid option moving forward to phase-in more fuel-efficient vehicles
into the Police Department Fleet. 
Energy and Emissions Impact Potential
While cost savings and simple payback calculations can inform the decision whether or not a particular
vehicle is a prime candidate for replacement with a more fuel-efficient option, the potential to reduce
energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions should be another driving factor in the purchasing
process. The following series of charts are based on the calculations performed by the AFLEET tool for
each scenario to produce an estimated annual gasoline consumption (barrels) and greenhouse gas
emissions (short tons). For each chart, the baseline “Gasoline” scenario is provided and can be compared to
the fuel-efficient scenarios presented for each segment of the City’s fleet.

Fleet Efficiency Action Plan 
Recommendation Summary
Based on the analysis completed for priority fleet segments, MAPC recommends the City consider taking
the following next steps to and incorporating the strategies identified into its vehicle purchasing plans for
the upcoming years. This summary incorporates additional recommendations regarding procurement, 
financing, and areas for further analysis. 
Sedans and SUVs
•  Replace DPW Highway Vehicle #157 and Inspections Vehicles #49 and #53 with full battery
electric options in the next 1-3 years. Consider replacing CPFM Vehicle #412 and DPW
Engineering Vehicles #138 and #147 with full battery electric options in the next 3-6 years. 
•  Target fuel inefficient sedans within the fleet that drive, on average, over 3,500 miles per year
for replacement with full battery electric options. 
•  Discuss fleet right sizing and pool vehicle options with the DPW Engineering Division to make
replacement of the vehicles with full battery electric options more financially viable. 
•  Replace the seven Ford Escapes with hybrid electric models, starting with Engineering Division
vehicles #145 and #146 (oldest).
•  Discuss with Engineering Division, Fire Department, and Inspections Department whether the
technical specs of Hyundai KONA Electric, or comparable all-electric SUV, will meet drivers needs
as replacements for the Ford Explorer SUVs. 
•  Target replacement of the full-size SUVs that have an annual mileage over 5,000 miles with an
all-electric SUV option, such as the Hyundai KONA or other models as they become available. 
FRAMINGHAM FLEET EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS FEBRUARY 2021  13
Page 84
•  For both Sedans and SUVs, discuss with Departments appropriate site for combined public and
fleet charging infrastructure. Consider using resources available through the Eversource Make-
Ready program to fund the installation costs. 
Light Duty Pick Ups
•  Conduct additional analysis using the AFLEET Tool when pricing and fuel economy is released by
Ford regarding the electric F150 to identify if more cost-effective than the XLP up-fit option tested
in this memo. 
•  Consider applying for Green Communities grant funding in 2021 to pilot the XLP up-fit on 1 to 2
F250 pickups within the City’s fleet that are due for replacement. Move forward with installation
of charging infrastructure if needed at the vehicle’s primary parking site. 
Police Cruisers 
•  Work with the Police Department to spec out the up-fit pricing for a standard gasoline and a
hybrid 2021 Ford Police Interceptor to verify the savings potential identified above. 
•  Commit to purchasing the hybrid option moving forward to phase-in more fuel-efficient vehicles
into the Police Department Fleet. 
Fleet-wide
•  Consider using statewide contract VEH98 to purchase electric and hybrid options and statewide
contract VEH102 for hybrid up-fit, idle reduction, and charging station equipment and services. 
•  Leverage Green Communities and Mass EVIP (Electric Vehicle Incentive Program) funds for
targeted replacement of sedans and SUVs with electric and hybrid options. 
•  Monitor available funding from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
(MassDEP) through the Volkswagen Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust. Future “Open
Solicitations” may provide opportunities to pilot higher cost electric models for medium- and
heavy-duty trucks within the City’s fleet. 
•  Consider procurement and installation of vehicle telematics across the fleet to inform future
analysis of vehicle efficiency and opportunities for cost savings.
