Laissez-faire
Laissez-faire ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˌlɛseɪˈfɛər/ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key"] LESS-ay-FAIR; from French: laissez faire [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/French"] [lɛse fɛʁ] (  listen), lit. 'let do') is an
 economic system in which transactions between private groups of people are free from any form of
 economic interventionism (such as subsidies) deriving from special interest groups. As a system of thought,
laissez-faire rests on the following axioms: "the individual is the basic unit in society, i.e. the standard of
measurement in social calculus; the individual has a natural right to freedom; and the physical order of
nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system."[1]
Another basic principle of laissez-faire holds that markets should naturally be competitive, a rule that the
early advocates of laissez-faire always emphasized.[1] With the aims of maximizing freedom by allowing
markets to self-regulate, early advocates of laissez-faire proposed a impôt unique, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"] tax on land rent (similar
to Georgism) to replace all taxes that they saw as damaging welfare by penalizing production.[2]
Proponents of laissez-faire argue for a near complete separation of government from the economic sector.[3]
The phrase laissez-faire is part of a larger French phrase and literally translates to "let [it/them] do", but in
this context the phrase usually means to "let it be" and in expression "laid back."[4] Although never
practiced with full consistency, laissez-faire [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism"] capitalism emerged in the mid-18th century and was further
popularized by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith"] Adam Smith's book [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations"] The Wealth of Nations.[5][6]
While associated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism"] capitalism in common usage, there are also non-capitalist forms of laissez-faire,
including some forms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism"] market socialism.

Etymology and usage
The term laissez-faire likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful French
 Controller-General of Finances [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Colbert"] Jean-Baptiste Colbert and a group of French [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Businessmen"] businessmen headed by M. Le
Gendre. When the eager [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism"] mercantilist minister asked how the French state could be of service to the
Page 2
merchants and help promote their commerce, Le Gendre replied simply: "Laissez-nous faire" ("Leave it to
us" or "Let us do [it]", the French verb not requiring an object).[7]
The anecdote on the Colbert–Le Gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the Journal économique,
written by French minister and champion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade"] free trade [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Louis_de_Voyer_de_Paulmy_d%27Argenson"] René de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson—also the first
known appearance of the term in print.[8] Argenson himself had used the phrase earlier (1736) in his own
diaries in a famous outburst:
Laissez faire, telle devrait être la devise de toute puissance publique, depuis que le monde est
civilisé [...]. Détestable principe que celui de ne vouloir grandir que par l'abaissement de nos
voisins ! Il n'y a que la méchanceté et la malignité du cœur de satisfaites dans ce principe, et
l’intérêt y est opposé. Laissez faire, morbleu ! Laissez faire !![9]
Let go, which should be the motto of all public power, since the world was civilized [...]. [It is]
a detestable principle of those that want to enlarge [themselves] but by the abasement of our
neighbours. There is but the wicked and the malignant heart[s] [who are] satisfied by this
principle and [its] interest is opposed. Let go, for God's sake! Let go!![10]
— René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson
 Vincent de Gournay, a French [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy"] Physiocrat and intendant of commerce in the 1750s, popularized the term
laissez-faire as he allegedly adopted it from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Quesnay"] François Quesnay's writings on China.[11] Quesnay coined the
phrases laissez-faire and laissez-passer,[12] laissez-faire being a translation of the Chinese term [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei"] wu wei (
無
為).[13] Gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in
France. Delighted with the Colbert–Le Gendre anecdote,[14] he forged it into a larger maxim all his own:
"Laissez faire et laissez passer" ("Let do and let pass"). His motto has also been identified as the longer
"Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même !" ("Let do and let pass, the world goes on by
itself!"). Although Gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas, he had immense personal
influence on his contemporaries, notably his fellow Physiocrats, who credit both the laissez-faire slogan and
the doctrine to Gournay.[15]
Before d'Argenson or Gournay, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Le_Pesant,_sieur_de_Boisguilbert"] P. S. de Boisguilbert had enunciated the phrase "On laisse faire la nature"
("Let nature run its course").[16] D'Argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar, but
less-celebrated motto "Pas trop gouverner" ("Govern not too much").[17]
The Physiocrats proclaimed laissez-faire in 18th-century France, placing it at the very core of their
economic principles and famous economists, beginning with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith"] Adam Smith, developed the idea.[18] It is with
the Physiocrats and the classical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy"] political economy that the term laissez-faire is ordinarily associated.[19]
The book Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State states: "The physiocrats, reacting against the
excessive mercantilist regulations of the France of their day, expressed a belief in a 'natural order' or liberty
under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good. Since, in their
view, this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government, they advised the state to
restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty, to removing all artificial
barriers to trade, and to abolishing all useless laws".[18]
The French phrase laissez-faire gained currency in English-speaking countries with the spread of
Physiocratic literature in the late 18th century. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whatley"] George Whatley's 1774 Principles of Trade (co-authored
with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin"] Benjamin Franklin) re-told the Colbert-LeGendre anecdote; this may mark the first appearance of the
phrase in an English-language publication.[20]
Page 3
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer"] Herbert Spencer was opposed to a slightly different application of laissez faire—to "that miserable laissez-
faire" that leads to men's ruin, saying: "Along with that miserable laissez-faire which calmly looks on while
men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims, there goes activity in supplying
them, at other men's cost, with gratis novel-reading!"[21]
As a product of the Enlightenment, laissez-faire was "conceived as the way to unleash human potential
through the restoration of a natural system, a system unhindered by the restrictions of government".[1] In a
similar vein, Adam Smith viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that
system. Smith saw laissez-faire as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of
 natural law.[1] By extension, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market"] free markets become a reflection of the natural system of liberty.[1] For Smith,
laissez-faire was "a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market, a program for the restoration
of order and for the activation of potential growth".[1]
However, Smith[22] and notable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economics"] classical economists such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Malthus"] Thomas Malthus and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo"] David Ricardo did not
use the phrase. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham"] Jeremy Bentham used the term, but it was probably [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mill"] James Mill's reference to the laissez-
faire maxim (together with the "Pas trop gouverner" motto) in an 1824 entry for the Encyclopædia
 Britannica that really brought the term into wider English usage. With the advent of the Anti-Corn Law
League (founded 1838), the term received much of its English meaning.[23]
Smith first used the metaphor of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand"] invisible hand in his book [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Moral_Sentiments"] The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) to
describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest.[24] Although
not the metaphor itself, the idea lying behind the invisible hand belongs to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Mandeville"] Bernard de Mandeville and his
 Fable of the Bees (1705). In political economy, that idea and the doctrine of laissez-faire have long been
closely related.[25] Some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for laissez-faire,[26]
although Smith never actually used the term himself.[22] In Third Millennium Capitalism (2000), Wyatt M.
Rogers Jr. notes a trend whereby recently "conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term
'free-market capitalism' in lieu of laissez-faire".[27]
American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_anarchists"] individualist anarchists such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Tucker"] Benjamin Tucker saw themselves as economic laissez-faire
socialists and political individualists while arguing that their "anarchistic socialism" or "individual
anarchism" was "consistent Manchesterism".[28]
History
Europe
In Europe, the laissez-faire movement was first widely promoted by the Physiocrats, a movement that
included [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Gournay"] Vincent de Gournay (1712–1759), a successful merchant turned political figure. Gournay is
 postulated to have adapted the Taoist concept wu wei,[29] from the writings on China by François
Quesnay[13] (1694–1774). Gournay held that government should allow the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law"] laws of nature to govern
economic activity, with the state only intervening to protect life, liberty and property. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Quesnay"] François Quesnay and
 Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l'Aulne took up Gournay's ideas. Quesnay had the ear of the King
of France, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XV_of_France"] Louis XV and in 1754 persuaded him to give laissez-faire a try. On September 17, the King
abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale and transport of grain. For more than a decade, the experiment
appeared successful, but 1768 saw a poor harvest, and the cost of bread rose so high that there was
widespread starvation while merchants exported grain in order to obtain the best profit. In 1770, the
 Comptroller-General of Finances [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marie_Terray"] Joseph Marie Terray revoked the edict allowing free trade in grain.[30]
Page 4
The doctrine of laissez-faire became an integral part of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism"] 19th-century European liberalism.[18] Just as liberals
supported [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_thought"] freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the
 principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics, seeing the state as merely a passive
policeman, protecting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property"] private property and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its
citizens. Businessmen, British industrialists in particular, were quick to associate these principles with their
own economic interests.[18] Many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout Europe and were
adopted to a greater or lesser extent in Sweden, Tuscany, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"] Spain and in the newly created [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States.
 Adam Smith, author of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations"] The Wealth of Nations (1776), met Quesnay and acknowledged his influence.[31]
In Britain, the newspaper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist"] The Economist (founded in 1843) became an influential voice for laissez-faire
capitalism.[32] Laissez-faire advocates opposed food aid for famines occurring within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"] British Empire. In
1847, referring to the famine then underway in Ireland, founder of The Economist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wilson_(businessman)"] James Wilson wrote: "It
 is no man's business to provide for another".[33] More specifically, in An Essay on the Principle of
Population, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthus"] Malthus argued that there was nothing that could be done to avoid famines because he felt he
had mathematically proven that population growth tends to exceed growth in food production. However,
 The Economist campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. The
 Great Famine in Ireland in 1845 led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The tariffs on grain which kept
the price of bread artificially high were repealed.[34] However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to
stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.[35]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bright"] A group that became known as the Manchester Liberals, to which Richard Cobden (1804–1865) and John
 Bright (1811–1889) belonged, were staunch defenders of free trade. After the death of Cobden, the Cobden
Club (founded in 1866) continued their work.[36] In 1860, Britain and France concluded a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobden-Chevalier_Treaty"] trade treaty,
after which other European countries signed several similar treaties. The breakdown of laissez-faire as
practised by the British Empire was partly led by British companies eager for state support of their positions
abroad, in particular British oil companies.[37]
United States
Frank Bourgin's study of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)"] Constitutional Convention and subsequent decades argues that direct
government involvement in the economy was intended by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"] Founding Fathers.[38] The reason for this
was the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"] Articles of Confederation. The goal
was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially
dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to
 promote science, invention, industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of promoting the
general welfare and making the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States"] economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their
own destiny. Others view Bourgin's study, written in the 1940s and not published until 1989, as an over-
 interpretation of the evidence, intended originally to defend the New Deal and later to counter Ronald
Reagan's economic policies.[39]
Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that in the 19th century [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States"] liberalism in the United States had
distinctive characteristics and that "at the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of
laissez-faire. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, laissez-faire did not mean "no
government intervention" at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide
tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers". Notable examples
of government intervention in the period prior to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] American Civil War include the establishment of the
 Patent Office in 1802; the establishment of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in 1830; the
creation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey"] Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor
 navigation; the various Army expeditions to the west, beginning with Lewis and Clark's Corps of
Discovery in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the
Page 5
Army [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corps_of_Topographical_Engineers"] Corps of Topographical Engineers and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers
that followed; the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of
 the early railroads and canals; and the establishment of the First Bank of the United States and Second
Bank of the United States as well as various protectionist measures (e.g. the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_Abominations"] tariff of 1828). Several of these
proposals met with serious opposition and required a great deal of horse-trading to be enacted into law. For
instance, the First National Bank would not have reached the desk of President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington in the
absence of an agreement that was reached between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton and several Southern members of
Congress to locate the capitol in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia"] District of Columbia. In contrast to Hamilton and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party"] Federalists was
 Thomas Jefferson and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison's opposing political party, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Democratic-Republicans.
 Most of the early opponents of laissez-faire capitalism in the United States subscribed to the American
School. This school of thought was inspired by the ideas of Hamilton, who proposed the creation of a
 government-sponsored bank and increased tariffs to favor Northern industrial interests. Following
Hamilton's death, the more abiding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism"] protectionist influence in the antebellum period came from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay"] Henry Clay
and his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_(economic_plan)"] American System. In the early 19th century, "it is quite clear that the laissez-faire label is an
inappropriate one" to apply to the relationship between the United States government and industry.[40] In
the mid-19th century, the United States followed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)"] Whig tradition of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_nationalism"] economic nationalism, which
 included increased state control, regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure.[41] Public
 works such as the provision and regulation transportation such as railroads took effect. The Pacific Railway
Acts provided the development of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Transcontinental_Railroad"] First Transcontinental Railroad.[41][42] In order to help pay for its
war effort in the Civil War, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"] United States government imposed its first personal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax"] income tax on 5 August
1861 as part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1861"] Revenue Act of 1861 (3% of all incomes over US$800; rescinded in 1872).
Following the Civil War, the movement towards a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy"] mixed economy accelerated. Protectionism increased
with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Tariff"] McKinley Tariff of 1890 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingley_Tariff"] Dingley Tariff of 1897. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_regulation"] Government regulation of the economy
expanded with the enactment of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Commerce_Act_of_1887"] Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Anti-trust_Act"] Sherman Anti-trust Act. The
 Progressive Era saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson"] Woodrow Wilson
administration's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Freedom"] New Freedom program. Following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"] World War I and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"] Great Depression, the United
States turned to a mixed economy which combined [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_enterprise"] free enterprise with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax"] progressive income tax and in
which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect American industry from
competition from overseas. For example, in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile
industry by "voluntary" export restrictions from Japan.[43]
In 1986, Pietro S. Nivola wrote: "By and large, the comparative strength of the dollar against major foreign
currencies has reflected high U.S. interest rates driven by huge federal budget deficits. Hence, the source of
much of the current deterioration of trade is not the general state of the economy, but rather the
government's mix of fiscal and monetary policies – that is, the problematic juxtaposition of bold tax
reductions, relatively tight monetary targets, generous military outlays, and only modest cuts in major
entitlement programs. Put simply, the roots of the trade problem and of the resurgent protectionism it has
fomented are fundamentally political as well as economic".[44]
A more recent advocate of total laissez-faire has been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism"] Objectivist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand"] Ayn Rand, who described it as "the
abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation of State
and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of Church and State".[45] This
viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the iron law of regulation, which is a theory stating that all
government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare.[46] Rand's political
philosophy emphasized [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_rights"] individual rights (including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property"] property rights)[47] and she considered laissez-faire
capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection
of those rights.[48] She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"] absolute monarchy,
Nazism, fascism, communism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism"] socialism and dictatorship.[49] Rand believed that natural rights should be
enforced by a constitutionally limited government.[50] Although her political views are often classified as
 conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term "radical for capitalism". She worked with conservatives
Page 6
on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.[51] She denounced
libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism.[52] She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in
 subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.[53]
Models
Capitalism
A closely related name for laissez-faire capitalism that of raw, pure, or unrestrained capitalism, which refers
to capitalism free of any regulations,[54] with low or minimal[55] government and operating almost entirely
on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_motive"] profit motive. It shares a similar economic conception with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism"] anarcho-capitalism. In modern economics
it typically has a bad connotation, which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs
and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit.
 Robert Kuttner states that "for over a century, popular struggles in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracies"] democracies have used the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-state"] nation-state
to temper raw capitalism. The power of voters has offset the power of capital. But as national barriers have
come down in the name of freer commerce, so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a
broad public interest. So the real issue is not 'trade' but democratic governance".[56]
The main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality, durability, sustainability, respect
for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection"] environment and human beings as well as a lack of morality.[57] From this more critical angle,
companies might naturally aim to maximise profits at the expense of workers' and broader social
interests.[58]
Advocates of laissez-faire capitalism argue that it relies on a constitutionally limited government that
unconditionally bans the initiation of force and coercion, including fraud. Therefore, free market
economists such as Milton Friedman and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell"] Thomas Sowell argue that, under such a system, relationships
between companies and workers are purely voluntary and mistreated workers will seek better treatment
elsewhere. Thus, most companies will compete for workers on the basis of pay, benefits, and work-life
balance just as they compete with one another in the marketplace on the basis of the relative cost and
quality of their goods.[59][60]
So-called "raw" or "hyper-capitalism" is a prime motive of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk"] cyberpunk in dystopian works such as
 Syndicate.[61][62]
Socialism
Although laissez-faire has been commonly associated with capitalism, there is a similar laissez-faire
 economic theory and system associated with socialism called left-wing laissez-faire,[63][64] or free-market
anarchism, also known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_market_anarchism"] free-market anti-capitalism and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism"] free-market socialism to distinguish it from
 laissez-faire capitalism.[65][66][67] One first example of this is mutualism as developed by Pierre-Joseph
Proudhon in the 18th century, from which emerged [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_anarchism"] individualist anarchism. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Tucker"] Benjamin Tucker is one
 eminent American individualist anarchist who adopted a laissez-faire system he termed anarchistic
socialism in contraposition to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism"] state socialism.[68][69] This tradition has been recently associated with
contemporary scholars such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Carson"] Kevin Carson,[70][71] Roderick T. Long,[72][73] Charles W. Johnson,[74]
Brad Spangler,[75] Sheldon Richman,[76][77][78] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Matthew_Sciabarra"] Chris Matthew Sciabarra[79] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Chartier"] Gary Chartier,[80] who
stress the value of radically free markets, termed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freed_market"] freed markets to distinguish them from the common
conception which these [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarians"] left-libertarians believe to be riddled with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist"] capitalist and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statist"] statist privileges.[81]
Referred to as left-wing market anarchists[82] or market-oriented left-libertarians,[78] proponents of this
Page 7
approach strongly affirm the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberal"] classical liberal ideas of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership"] self-ownership and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market"] free markets while maintaining
that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalist"] anti-capitalist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corporatist"] anti-corporatist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_hierarchies"] anti-hierarchical
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-labor"] pro-labor positions in economics; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-imperialism"] anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views
regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality and race.[83][84] Critics of laissez-faire as commonly
understood argues that a truly laissez-faire system would be anti-capitalist and socialist.[85][86]
Kevin Carson describes his politics as on "the outer fringes of both free market [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism"] libertarianism and
socialism"[87] and has also been highly critical of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property"] intellectual property.[88] Carson has identified the work
of Benjamin Tucker, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hodgskin"] Thomas Hodgskin, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Borsodi"] Ralph Borsodi, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goodman_(writer)"] Paul Goodman, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Mumford"] Lewis Mumford, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom"] Elinor Ostrom,
 Peter Kropotkin and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich"] Ivan Illich as sources of inspiration for his approach to politics and economics.[89] In
addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker's big four monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents),
he argues that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state"] state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational
centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. Carson believes that Tucker
overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions whereas he also focuses on
organizational issues. As such, the primary focus of his most recent work has been decentralized
 manufacturing and the informal and household economies.[90] The theoretical sections of Carson's Studies
in Mutualist Political Economy are also presented as an attempt to integrate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalist"] marginalist critiques into the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value"] labor theory of value.[91]
In response to claims that he uses the term capitalism incorrectly, Carson says he is deliberately choosing to
resurrect what he claims to be an old definition of the term in order to "make a point". He claims that "the
term 'capitalism,' as it was originally used, did not refer to a free market, but to a type of statist class system
in which capitalists controlled the state and the state intervened in the market on their behalf".[92] Carson
holds that "capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages"] Middle Ages,
was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism"] feudal conquest of the land. It has been
sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its
survival is unimaginable".[93] Carson argues that in a truly laissez-faire system the ability to extract a profit
from labor and capital would be negligible.[94] Carson coined the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative"] pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a
 phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic
 inequality. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase vulgar political economy which Karl
Marx described as an economic order that "deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes
strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic
life]".[95]
Gary Chartier offers an understanding of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights"] property rights as contingent yet tightly constrained social
strategies, reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership"] ownership and of
 natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust yet non-absolute protections for these
rights in a manner similar to that employed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume"] David Hume.[96] This account is distinguished both from
 Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from
 consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups
and individuals.[97] Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the
view that solidaristic wealth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_(economics)"] redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response
by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to
achieve a particular distributive pattern.[98] He advances detailed arguments for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_democracy"] workplace democracy
rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity,[99] defending it as morally desirable and as a likely
outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.[100]
Chartier has discussed natural law approaches to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform"] land reform and to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_factories"] occupation of factories by
workers.[101] He objects on natural law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory
of property rights more generally[102] and develops a general natural law account of boycotts.[103] He has
argued that proponents of genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the
global anti-capitalist movement while emphasizing that the abuses the anti-capitalist movement highlights
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_capitalism"]
Page 8
result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and
exchange. According to Chartier, "it makes sense for [freed-market advocates] to name what they oppose
'capitalism.'  Doing so calls attention to the freedom movement's radical roots, emphasizes the value of
understanding society as an alternative to the state, underscores the fact that proponents of freedom object
to non-aggressive as well as aggressive restraints on liberty, ensures that advocates of freedom aren't
confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity
between defenders of freed markets and workers — as well as ordinary people around the world who use
"capitalism" as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their
lives".[93][104]
Criticism
Over the years, a number of economists have offered critiques of laissez-faire economics. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith"] Adam Smith
acknowledges some moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism.[105] Smith had misgivings
concerning some aspects of each of the major character-types produced by modern capitalist society,
namely the landlords, the workers and the capitalists.[105] Smith claimed that "[t]he landlords' role in the
economic process is passive. Their ability to reap a revenue solely from ownership of land tends to make
them indolent and inept, and so they tend to be unable to even look after their own economic interests"[105]
and that "[t]he increase in population should increase the demand for food, which should increase rents,
which should be economically beneficial to the landlords". According to Smith, the landlords should be in
favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations, but they often are not in favour
of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolent-induced ignorance and intellectual
flabbiness.[105]
Many philosophers have written on the systems society has created to manage their civilizations. Thomas
Hobbes utilized the concept of a "state of nature," which is a time before any government or laws, as a
starting point to consider the question. In this time, life would be "war of all against all." Further, "In such
condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain . . . continual fear and danger
of violent death, and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."[106] Smith was quite clear that
he believed that without morality and laws, society would fail. From that perspective, it would be strange
for Smith to support a pure Laissez-Faire style of capitalism, and what he does support in Wealth of Nations
is heavily dependent on the moral philosophy from his previous work, Theory of Moral Sentiments.[107]
Regardless of preferred political preference, all societies require shared moral values as a prerequisite on
which to build laws to protect individuals from each other. Adam Smith wrote Wealth of Nations during the
Enlightenment, a period of time when the prevailing attitude was, "All things can be Known." In effect,
European thinkers, inspired by the likes of Isaac Newton and others, set about to "find the laws" of all
things, that there existed a "natural law" underlying all aspects of life. They believed that these could be
discovered and that everything in the universe could be rationally demystified and cataloged, including
human interactions.[108]
Critics and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_abolitionism"] market abolitionists such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McNally_(professor)"] David McNally argue in the Marxist tradition that the logic of the
market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that Smith's
moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free
market he championed. According to McNally, the development of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy"] market economy involved coercion,
exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance.[109]
The British economist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes"] John Maynard Keynes condemned laissez-faire economic policy on several
occasions.[110] In The End of Laissez-faire (1926), one of the most famous of his critiques, Keynes argues
that the doctrines of laissez-faire are dependent to some extent on improper deductive reasoning and says
Page 9
the question of whether a market solution or state intervention is better must be determined on a case-by-
case basis.[111]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School"] Austrian School economist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek"] Friedrich Hayek stated that a freely competitive, laissez-faire banking
industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical, arguing that the need for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_banking"] central banking
control was inescapable.[112]
Karl Polanyi's Great Transformation criticizes self-regulating markets as aberrational, unnatural phenomena
which tend towards social disruption.[113][114]
