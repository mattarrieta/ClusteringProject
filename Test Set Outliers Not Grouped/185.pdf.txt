Jim Dent calls it college football’s lost story. 
Maybe it is. History fades fast. The long-ago days of Oklahoma football,
when mythical Sooner heroes reigned, was the ’70s. The dinosaur days are the ’50s, when Bud Wilkinson coached OU to
heights unscaled before or since. Prehistoric.

“You’re Out and You’re Ugly, Too,” with baseball umpire (and OU fan)
Durwood Merrill. 
“No one will ever break the 47-game streak,” Dent said. “It’s the lost
