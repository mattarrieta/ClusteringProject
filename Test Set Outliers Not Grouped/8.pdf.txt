1. My reputation. Jeff would help with that and give me any kind of recommendation
I needed. 
2. No non-compete. Get on with my new life starting right now. Jeff said he did not
want to get in trouble by granting blanket exemption from the non-compete but
anything I found he could imagine that I wanted to do he would agree to, just call
him, easier to do it that way.
3. Paid out under my contract for involuntary termination. No problem.
4. Transition. Kids situation in school we need 5 months in Brazil. Need coverage of
visa, expat benefits, salary, etc, still being an employee on the roles but outside the
company. Jeff said to get with Steve Kean to close out the details on this and the rest
of the deal. I can enumerate what this entails (can discuss with Steve seperately),
but suggest that this be delegated to Miguel Padron.
5. Bonus for 2000. Jeff said that we were not approved by the board for a bonus for
2000. He said we did not make our numbers anyway. I told him that the ability to
make our numbers was taken out of our hands earlier in the year (1. asset sale
started by Corp, moved to Project California, moved to summer, then returned to
Corp; 2. 4th qtr reorg moving ESA P&L to ENA, who wanted to reserve money for next
year, not booking big ticket items in fourth quarter) so this was not fair. He said he
would consider this.
6. Neglected to mention bonuses for Sarlux and Puerto Rico that are due soon and
should be paid when due under involuntary termination.
