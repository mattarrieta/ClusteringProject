Abstract 
Background:  Given that abnormal autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of cancers, we sought to explore the
potential value of autophagy-associated genes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
Methods:  RNA sequencing and clinical data on tumour and normal samples were acquired from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and randomly assigned to training and testing groups. Differentially expressed
autophagy-associated genes (AAGs) were screened. Within the training group, Cox regression and Lasso regres-
sion analyses were conducted to screen five prognostic AAGs, which were used to develop a model. Kaplan–Meier
(KM) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to determine the performance of the model
in both groups. Immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the differential expression of AAGs in tumour and
normal tissues at the protein level. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were utilized to further elucidate the roles of AAGs in LUAD.
Results:  The data from the TCGA database included 497 tumour and 54 normal samples, within which 30 differen-
tially expressed AAGs were screened. Using Cox regression and Lasso regression analyses for the training group, 5
prognostic AAGs were identified and the prognostic model was constructed. Patients with low risk had better overall
survival (OS) in the training group (3-year OS, 73.0% vs 48.0%; 5-year OS, 45.0% vs 33.8%; P = 1.305E−04) and in the
testing group (3-year OS, 66.8% vs 41.2%; 5-year OS, 31.7% vs 25.8%; P = 1.027E−03). The areas under the ROC curves
(AUC) were significant for both the training and testing groups (3-year AUC, 0.810 vs 0.894; 5-year AUC, 0.792 vs 0.749).
Conclusions:  We developed a survival model for LUAD and validated the performance of the model, which may
provide superior outcomes for the patients.

Background
Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortal-
ity rates worldwide and is therefore a constant threat
to human life [1].  Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a
prevalent pathological subtype of lung cancer, account-
ing for nearly 45% of lung cancer. Despite advances in

Institute and Hospital, Huanhu West Rd, Tianjin, China 
the global medical industry and changes in health aware-
ness, the outcomes of patients with lung cancer remain
poor, in part because almost 80% of the patients are at
an advanced stage when diagnosed; another reason may
be that the current TNM (tumour size/lymph nodes/dis-
tant metastasis) staging system is not always accurate for
postoperative tumour staging, and therefore necessary
adjuvant treatments may not be applied [2, 3]. Therefore, 
it is necessary to explore alternative methods for diagno-
sis and accurate postoperative tumour staging.

Autophagy is considered a vital catabolic process
within eukaryotic cells, allowing lysosomes to degrade
damaged, senescent, or nonfunctional proteins and
organelles [4, 5].  Early studies have reported that
autophagy is involved in many pathophysiological pro-
cesses such as immune responses, inflammation, neu-
rodegenerative diseases, tumourigenesis and cancer
progression [6, 7]. Early in 1976, JS et al. first reported
that cellular autophagocytosis progressed in cervical
cancer cells in the absence of serum and amino acids
[8]. Later studies showed that autophagy may play a
part in degrading and recycling components of non-
functional organelles to supply the demands of tumour
progression [9, 10]. Nassour et al. demonstrated that
autophagy was vital for tumour suppression, and the
absence of autophagy was necessary for the initiation
of tumours [11].  Therefore, autophagy may not only
be involved in the inhibition of cancer but may also
be related to the development and advancement of
tumours [12–14].
Over the last decade, scholars have performed many
studies to explore the role of autophagy in LUAD. 
Some studies have concluded that downregulat-
ing autophagy indirectly enhances the efficacy of the
LUAD suppressors [15–17];  conversely, high-level
autophagy was proven to promote tumourigenesis
of LUAD in other studies [18–22]. Some results have
provided evidence that the upregulation of autophagy
is correlated with cisplatin or docetaxel resistance
in LUAD [23–25]. Wang et al. found that autophagy
impacted the low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity of LUAD
[26].
Given these contradictory results, we sought to
explore the potential value of autophagy in LUAD by
integrating the entire set of autophagy-associated
genes (AAGs) and the corresponding gene expression
with clinical data acquired from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) portal. First, 30 AAGs that were differ-
entially expressed in tumour and non-tumour tissues
were screened and randomly divided into training and
testing groups. We then performed Cox regression and
Lasso regression analyses within the training group to
identify the AAGs associated with remarkable overall
survival (OS) in LUAD patients, and the prognostic
model was constructed. To validate the accuracy of
the model, the Kaplan–Meier (KM) estimator and the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were
applied. In addition, we investigated the results of
Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) path-
way analyses to further elucidate the role of AAGs in
LUAD. 
Materials and methods
Data source and pre‑processing
The entire set of 232 AAGs was collected from the
human autophagy portal ([URL: "http://www.autophagy.lu/index.html"] http://www.autop​hagy.lu/
 index​.html), which is an online database that provides
a complete set of human genes related to autophagy as
described in the literature. RNA sequencing and clini-
cal data consisting of 497 LUAD and 54 non-tumour
tissues was downloaded from the TCGA data portal. 
The ensemble gene IDs were then converted to gene
symbols using the online database GENCODE ([URL: "https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/releases.html"] https​://
 www.genco​degen​es.org/human​/relea​ses.html),  a pro-
ject for referencing human genome annotation. Finally, 
the expression data of the AAGs were extracted.
Screening of differentially expressed AAGs in LUAD
The expression data of 232 AAGs comprising 497
LUAD and 54 non-tumour samples were processed
using the mean function, and the mean expression val-
ues were normalized by log2 transformation. The 30
AAGs that were differentially expressed between the
tumour and normal samples were then identified using
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in R (version 3.6.1, https​
 ://www.r-proje​ct.org/)  with a threshold of |log(fold
change) > 1 and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. 
Next, we integrated the expression data of the 30 AAGs
with the corresponding clinical information. Finally, the
data were randomly divided into training and testing
groups for subsequent validation.
The expression data of the 30 AAGs within the train-
ing group were then analysed using univariate Cox
regression analysis to obtain the AAGs that were signif-
icantly related to survival (P < 0.05). The least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression
selectively enters variables into the model to obtain
improved performance parameters and to control the
complexity of the model through a series of param-
eters to avoid overfitting [27]. Therefore, we employed
a Lasso regression analysis to remove highly correlated
survival-related AAGs.
Construction of the prognostic model
We performed a multivariate Cox regression analysis
using both forward and backward selection to identify
the 5 prognostic AAGs and their coefficients, on which
we constructed the prognostic model. Every LUAD
patient in both training and testing groups received an
individual risk score.
The calculation of the risk score based on
the AAG model was conducted as follows:

Validating the performance of the prognostic model
in training and testing groups
Based on the individual risk scores, all patients were
separated into one of two groups (low/high score) by the
median risk scores. The Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival
curve was plotted to evaluate the differences in overall
survival between the two groups using the log-rank test
to assign statistical significance. In addition, we gener-
ated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to
determine the accuracy of the prognostic model.
Exploration of the expression of AAGs at the protein level
The Human Protein Atlas is an interactive web-based
database ([URL: "https://www.proteinatlas.org"] https​://www.prote​inatl​as.org) that contains
the RNA and protein expression profiles of more than
ninety percent of the putative protein-encoding genes
and includes more than 13 million high-resolution
images [28]. The immunohistochemical results of the five
prognostic AAGs were explored using this database to
verify their differential expression in tumour and normal
tissues.
Enrichment analysis of AAGs
To explore the potential tumour-related molecular mech-
anisms of AAGs, GO functional annotation and KEGG
pathway enrichment analyses were performed in R using
the packages DOSE, Cluster Profiler, ggplot2, GO plot, 
etc. with both the p-value and q-value set at 0.05. The 
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses and graphics were performed
using the R 3.6.1 ([URL: "https://www.r-project.org/"] https​://www.r-proje​ct.org/) and Perl
language packages. Cox regression analyses were utilized
to screen the AAGs related to survival. A Lasso regres-
sion analysis was used to eliminate highly correlated
AAGs and prevent overfitting of the model. The Kaplan–
Meier curve was plotted to display the differences in
overall survival between the two groups and the log-rank
test was performed to determine the significance of the
differences. The ROC curve and the corresponding area
under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the model. Statistical significance was defined
as P < 0.05.
Results
Differentially expressed AAGs in lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD)
We analysed the expression of 232 AAGs in 497 LUAD
and 54 non-tumour tissues using the Wilcoxon signed-
rank test in R, and 30 AAGs were eventually identified
using the criteria of |log2FC| > 1 and FDR < 0.05, includ-
ing 12 downregulated genes (NRG3, DLC1, NLRC4, 
HSPB8, DAPK2, PPP1R15A, FOS, NRG1, PRKCQ, 
CCL2, GRID1, MAP1LC3C) and 18 upregulated genes

Survival‑related AAGs and the prognostic model
We conducted a univariate Cox regression analy-
sis and identified 6 AAGs (GAPDH, ERO1A, NLRC4, 
ITGB4, ATG9B, and CDKN2A) that were significantly
related to LUAD survival in the training group. Of the
6 survival-related AAGs, 4 genes (GAPDH, ERO1A, 
ITGB4, and CDKN2A) were considered risk factors (all
P < 0.05; HRs, 1.0007–1.0175) and that their overexpres-
sion may reduce survival; overexpression of the remain-
ing two genes (NLRC4 and ATG9B) (all P < 0.05; HRs, 
0.6913 and 0.7382, respectively) may improve the sur-
vival of patients. The Lasso regression analysis was then
applied to exclude genes that may be highly correlated
with other genes (Fig. 3). The 6 survival-related AAGs
were then submitted to a multivariate Cox proportional
hazards model, resulting in 5 candidate genes (ITGB4, 
NLRC4, ATG9B, CDKN2A, and ERO1A) that may
serve as significant predictors of the prognosis (Table 1).
Based on the 5 candidate AAGs, the formula for the
risk score of every LUAD patient was constructed: risk
score = (expression value of ITGB4 * 0.0063) + (-expres-
sion value of NLRC4 * 0.354) + (-expression value of 
ATG9B * 0.3956) + (expression value of CDKN2A *
0.0202) + (expression value of ERO1A * 0.0122).
Validation of the model performance
To validate the accuracy of the model, we plotted the
KM survival curve to evaluate the difference in LUAD
survival in both the training and testing groups. In the
training group, the median overall survival of low-risk
patients was 4.11 years, whereas the survival of high-
risk patients was 2.86 years. In comparison, in the test-
ing group, the median overall survival of patients with
low-risk scores was 3.9 years, and the survival of patients
with high-risk scores was 2.34 years. Low-risk patients
exhibited higher survival than high-risk patients in the
training group (3-year OS, 73.0% vs 48.0%; 5-year OS, 
45.0% vs 33.8%; P = 1.305E−04) and in the testing group
(3-year OS, 66.8% vs 41.2%; 5-year OS, 31.7% vs 25.8%;
P = 1.027E−03) (Fig. 4a, b). Furthermore, we constructed
the ROC curve to assess the accuracy of the model, and
the areas under the ROC curves in the training and test-
ing groups were both significant (3-year AUC, 0.810 vs
0.894; 5-year AUC, 0.792 vs 0.749) (Fig. 4c, d).
In addition, we ranked the all of the LUAD patients
by their risk scores to analyse the survival distribution. 
From the scatterplot, we could identify the survival status
of patients with different risk scores; the mortality rate
of patients rose with the increase in risk score. The heat

Differential expression of prognostic AAGs at the protein
level
We used immunohistochemistry to compare the expres-
sion of the 5 prognostic AAGs (ITGB4, NLRC4, ATG9B, 
CDKN2A, and ERO1A) in LUAD with their expression
in normal tissues (Fig. 6a–d). As expected, the levels of
protein expression of the three high-risk genes (ITGB4, 
CDKN2A, and ERO1A) were demonstrably higher in
tumour tissues with more intense antibody staining and a
greater proportion of stained cells. In contrast, NLRC4, a
protective gene, stained fewer cells with weaker intensity
in LUAD. The results were compatible with our findings 
GO and KEGG analyses of AAGs
To evaluate the molecular mechanisms of AAGs in
LUAD, GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway
enrichment analyses were conducted (Table 2).  GO
analysis consists of three categories: biological pro-
cesses (BP), cellular components (CC) and molecular
function (MF). We found that the most significant GO
enriched terms involved in autophagy were the intrin-
sic apoptotic signalling pathway, cellular response to
unfolded/topologically incorrect proteins and neu-
ron death (BP);  autophagosome and endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (CC); and

protein phosphatase binding, chemorepellent activity,

binding (MF) (Fig. 7a, b).  In the KEGG enrichment
analysis, the AAGs were primarily correlated with path-
ways related to autophagy-animal, the ErbB signalling
pathway, bladder cancer, the HIF-1 signalling pathway, 
platinum drug resistance, proteins processed in the
endoplasmic reticulum, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
resistance, PD-L1 expression and the PD-1 checkpoint
pathway in cancer (Fig. 8a, b). 
Discussion
Adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent histological sub-
type of lung cancer and has been broadly explored for
distinct genetic drivers and diverse prognostic factors. 
However, LUAD patients still experience high mor-
tality due to undetected pathogenesis [29–31].  Many
researchers believe that the existing guidelines and def-
initions of lung cancer may result in different clinical
decisions for preoperative and postoperative patients.

nodes was related to a better prognosis, although this
was not recommended by the International Associa-
tion for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) [32]. There
are also scholars who believe that the present stag-
ing guide is insufficient for predicting individual-level
overall survival because many early-stage patients may
experience a later relapse [33, 34].  Moreover, Valeria
et al. suggested abandoning the concept of non-small
cell lung cancer because a large body of experimental
evidence suggests that LUAD and lung squamous cell
carcinoma appear to be distinct tumours at the molec-
ular, pathological and clinical levels [35].  Therefore, 
academics have placed increasing emphasis on the use
of precision medicine in lung cancer [36–38]. It is nec-
essary to explore methods to consolidate the current
staging system and to improve the prognosis for lung
cancer patients. Over the last decade, breakthroughs
in microarrays and genome sequencing have promoted
the discovery of prognostic biomarkers, which have
greatly increased the accurate classification of diseases
and improved individual treatment. Many studies have
demonstrated that genomic data, particularly multi-
gene signatures, demonstrate superior performance in 
prognosis analysis compared with the current staging
system [39–42].
To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine
the entire set of AAGs with LUAD and explore as well
as validate the potential value of AAGs in LUAD. First, 
we selected 30 differentially expressed AAGs from 497
tumour samples and 54 normal samples. We then ran-
domly divided the data into training and testing groups. 
Using Lasso regression and Cox survival analyses, we
constructed a risk model based on five prognostic AAGs
(ITGB4, NLRC4, ATG9B, CDKN2A, and ERO1A). Using
the model, every LUAD patient was assigned a risk score. 
The differences in survival between patients with low and
high scores were significant in both the training group
and the testing group. The ROC curves and AUCs indi-
cated that models of the training and testing groups both
performed well. In addition, we performed immunohis-
tochemistry that further proved the significant roles of
AAGs in LUAD. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrich-
ment analyses of the differentially expressed AAGs were
conducted to explore the underlying molecular mecha-
nisms. The results of GO functional annotation revealed
that the AAGs were primarily enriched in the intrinsic

apoptotic signalling pathway, cellular response to topo-
logically incorrect proteins and the PERK-mediated
unfolded protein response, which is consistent with the
conclusion of previous studies that autophagy is a physi-
ological process that eliminates misfolded proteins and
damaged organelles in response to cellular stress [12, 
43]. In the KEGG pathway analysis, AAGs were primar-
ily enriched in the ErbB, IL-17 and HIF-1 signalling path-
ways. EGFR (ErbB1) is not unknown to us; in 2004, there
was a major discovery that treatment with the EGFR-TKI
(epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tor) gefitinib caused tumour regression in some patients
with NSCLC [44], and the third-generation EGFR-TKI
axitinib confers greater survival benefits to patients, par-
ticularly those with the T790M mutation [45]. In addi-
tion to EGFR (ErbB1), the proteins HER2 (ErbB2), HER3
(ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4) compose the ErbB family of
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which
is one of the most broadly explored therapeutic tar-
gets in human malignancies [46]. Jutten et al. found that 
autophagy activity influenced the expression of EGFR
and the resistance to EGFR-targeting therapies could be
reduced by downregulating autophagy [47, 48];  IL-17
(interleukin-17), as a signature proinflammatory cytokine
of the CD4+ T helper 17 (Th17) cells [49], was shown to
participate in the formation and advancement of various
tumours [50] and was widely distributed in the tumour
microenvironment, where it has twin roles in tumouri-
genesis and tumour suppression [51].  Previous studies
have indicated that the formation of lung cancer is closely
related to local dysbiosis and inflammation mediated by
Th17 cells [52, 53]. The 2019 Nobel Prize in physiology
or medicine was awarded to Professor William G. Kaelin
Jr., Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza for their
contributions to elucidating the mechanisms by which
cells sense and adapt to the availability of oxygen. They
found that HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) regu-
lates more than 4000 targeted genes, some of which can
increase oxygen transport for angiogenesis and eryth-
ropoiesis. Another study reported that under emergent

oxygen fluctuations, autophagy can be harmful and can
lead to cell death [54]. Moreover, Bellot et al. reported
that various mechanisms such as autophagy activation
enabled tumour cells to adjust to hypoxia [55]. There-
fore, the regulation of HIF-1 may represent an important 
breakthrough in tumour therapy, as angiogenesis and
erythropoiesis play crucial roles in the occurrence and
development of cancer.
It is apparent that autophagy plays many roles in
tumourigenesis and development, which is consistent

with the association between autophagy genes and LUAD
in our study. However, some limitations are worth noting. 
As a retrospective study, this research has an inherent
bias; although we validated the model using training/test-
ing sets and immunohistochemistry, additional valida-
tion of prognostic designs should be conducted in vitro, 
in vivo and in clinical trials; moreover, the biological pro-
cesses and molecular mechanisms of the 5 AAGs should 
be further evaluated to accelerate their clinical applica-
tion in LUAD.
Conclusions
In this study, we provided insights into the roles of
autophagy genes in LUAD and constructed a promis-
ing model, which could provide a reference to determine
whether postoperative/preoperative patients are at high

improved prognosis.
