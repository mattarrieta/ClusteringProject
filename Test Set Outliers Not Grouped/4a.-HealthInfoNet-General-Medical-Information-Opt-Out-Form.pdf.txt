Opt-out Form 
(to not share general health information) 
If you want to share your health information through HealthInfoNet, 
you do not need to do anything with this form. 
What is HealthInfoNet? 
HealthInfoNet is a secure computer system that brings your health information from different healthcare providers into one
statewide electronic health record. Your providers use this information to make better decisions about your care. It can also
help them prevent mistakes, especially in an emergency. Your health record includes information about your medicines, 
allergies, test results, and more. 
Are my records private and secure? 
HealthInfoNet encrypts all information and sends it over secure computer connections. Only those involved in your care can
look at your information. To find out who has looked at your record and when they looked at it, go to
 www.hinfonet.org/audit. Of course, no system is completely secure, but HeathInfoNet makes every effort to keep your
records safe. 
What does it mean to “opt-out”?
If you do not want your health information in a HealthInfoNet record, fill out this form to “opt-out”, or not share your health
information. Your choice to opt-out will not affect your ability to get medical care. If you decide later that you want to have a
HealthInfoNet record, you will need to call HealthInfoNet or fill out an “opt-in” form on the HealthInfoNet website at 
 www.hinfonet.org/yourchoices
