Health Screening Opt-Out Form
According to the guidelines established by the Florida Legislature, at the beginning of each year, parents shall be notified of the screen-
ing activities available through the School Health Services Program. Florida Statue 381.0056(5)(g), mandates health screening to public
school students in Kindergarten (KG), 1st, 3rd and 6th grades and for students new to the county. It should be understood that such screen-
ings do not substitute for a thorough examination by a health care provider.
The screenings include vision, hearing, height and weight, Body Mass Index (BMI) and Scoliosis. They are offered in an effort to decrease
health barriers to learning and may be performed individually or in groups. Parents or guardians have the right to opt their child out
of the screenings.
Note: If you DO NOT want your child to receive one or more of the screenings, please check the appropriate box below, print
and sign your name, and return this form to your child’s school WITHIN 10 DAYS FROM THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL or from
the date of enrollment, if a student enrolls after the start of each school year.
