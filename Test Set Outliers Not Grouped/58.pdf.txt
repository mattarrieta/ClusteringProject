RE: Program Date Change  DATE: October 4, 2001
_______________________________________________________________________
As noted in the Roster, the date for the Medical Center Mini-University was tentative. 
The reason for this was our trying to confirm a truly outstanding keynote speaker. We
are very pleased to announce that Jeff Immelt, the new CEO of General Electric, will be
our speaker. Due to his having a conflict with the original date, we can now confirm the
date of Tuesday, April 9, 2002, for this event. That means the Monterrey Chapter
Invasion consisting of golf at Shadow Hawk, open house and lunch at the Decorative
Center of Houston and the dine-around will now take place on Monday, April 8, 2002.
Please mark these date changes in your Roster. 
We look forward to your participation in this very exciting and educational event.
