Cell biology
Cell biology (also cellular biology or cytology) is a branch of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"] biology that studies the structure, function,
and behavior of cells.[1][2] All living organisms are made of cells. A cell is the basic unit of life that is
responsible for the living and functioning of organisms. Cell biology is the study of structural and
functional units of cells. Cell biology encompasses both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"] prokaryotic and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"] eukaryotic cells and has many
subtopics which may include the study of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"] cell metabolism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_pathway"] cell communication, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"] cell cycle, biochemistry,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"] cell composition. The study of cells is performed using several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"] microscopy techniques, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"] cell culture, and
 cell fractionation. These have allowed for and are currently being used for discoveries and research
pertaining to how cells function, ultimately giving insight into understanding larger organisms. Knowing
the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences while also being
essential for research in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-medical"] biomedical fields such as cancer, and other diseases. Research in cell biology is
 interconnected to other fields such as genetics, molecular genetics, molecular biology, medical
microbiology, immunology, and cytochemistry.

History
Cells were first seen in 17th century Europe with the invention of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_microscope#Compound_microscope"] compound microscope. In 1665,
 Robert Hooke termed the building block of all living organisms as "cells" (published in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrographia"] Micrographia) after
looking at a piece of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(material)"] cork and observing a cell-like structure,[3][4] however, the cells were dead and gave no
indication to the actual overall components of a cell. A few years later, in 1674, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Van_Leeuwenhoek"] Anton Van Leeuwenhoek
was the first to analyze live cells in his examination of algae. All of this preceded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_theory"] cell theory which
states that all living things are made up of cells and that cells are the functional and structural unit of
organisms. This was ultimately concluded by plant scientist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Jakob_Schleiden"] Matthias Schleiden[4] and animal scientist
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Schwann"] Theodor Schwann in 1838, who viewed live cells in plant and animal tissue, respectively.[5] 19 years later,
 Rudolf Virchow further contributed to the cell theory, adding that all cells come from the division of pre-
existing cells.[5] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viruses"] Viruses are not considered in cell biology – they lack the characteristics of a living cell, and
instead are studied in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"] microbiology subclass of virology.[6]
Techniques
Cell biology research looks at different ways to culture and manipulate cells outside of a living body to
further research in human anatomy and physiology, and to derive medications. The techniques by which
cells are studied have evolved. Due to advancements in microscopy, techniques and technology have
allowed scientists to hold a better understanding of the structure and function of cells. Many techniques
commonly used to study cell biology are listed below:[7]
 Cell culture: Utilizes rapidly growing cells on media which allows for a large amount of a
specific cell type and an efficient way to study cells.[8] Cell culture is one of the major tools
used in cellular and molecular biology, providing excellent model systems for studying the
normal physiology and biochemistry of cells (e.g., metabolic studies, aging), the effects of
drugs and toxic compounds on the cells, and mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. It is also
used in drug screening and development, and large scale manufacturing of biological
compounds (e.g., vaccines, therapeutic proteins).
 Fluorescence microscopy: Fluorescent markers such as GFP, are used to label a specific
component of the cell. Afterwards, a certain light wavelength is used to excite the fluorescent
marker which can then be visualized.[8]
 Phase-contrast microscopy: Uses the optical aspect of light to represent the solid, liquid, and
gas-phase changes as brightness differences.[8]
 Confocal microscopy: Combines fluorescence microscopy with imaging by focusing light
and snap shooting instances to form a 3-D image.[8]
 Transmission electron microscopy: Involves metal staining and the passing of electrons
through the cells, which will be deflected upon interaction with metal. This ultimately forms
an image of the components being studied.[8]
Cytometry: The cells are placed in the machine which uses a beam to scatter the cells
based on different aspects and can therefore separate them based on size and content.
Cells may also be tagged with GFP-fluorescence and can be separated that way as well.[9]
 Cell fractionation: This process requires breaking up the cell using high temperature or
sonification followed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation"] centrifugation to separate the parts of the cell allowing for them to be
studied separately.[8]

Cell types
There are two fundamental classifications of cells: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"] prokaryotic and
eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are distinguished from eukaryotic cells
by the absence of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"] cell nucleus or other membrane-bound
organelle.[10] Prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic
cells, making them the smallest form of life.[11] Prokaryotic cells
include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"] Bacteria and Archaea, and lack an enclosed cell nucleus.
 Eukaryotic cells are found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists.
They range from 10–100 μm in diameter, and their DNA is
contained within a membrane-bound nucleus. Eukaryotes are
organisms containing eukaryotic cells. The four eukaryotic
kingdoms are Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and Protista.
They both reproduce through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_fission"] binary fission. Bacteria, the most
prominent type, have several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_cell_structure#Cell_morphology"] different shapes, although most are A drawing of a prokaryotic cell
 spherical or rod-shaped. Bacteria can be classed as either gram-
positive or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria"] gram-negative depending on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall#Bacterial_cell_wall"] cell wall composition.
Gram-positive bacteria have a thicker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptidoglycan_layer"] peptidoglycan layer than gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial structural
features include a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum"] flagellum that helps the cell to move,[12] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"] ribosomes for the translation of RNA to
protein,[12] and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoid"] nucleoid that holds all the genetic material in a circular structure.[12] There are many
processes that occur in prokaryotic cells that allow them to survive. In prokaryotes, mRNA synthesis is
initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA template comprising two consensus sequences that recruit
RNA polymerase. The prokaryotic polymerase consists of a core enzyme of four protein subunits and a σ
protein that assists only with initiation. For instance, in a process termed conjugation, the fertility factor
allows the bacteria to possess a pilus which allows it to transmit DNA to another bacteria which lacks the F
factor, permitting the transmittance of resistance allowing it to survive in certain environments.[13]
Structure and function
Structure of eukaryotic cells
 Eukaryotic cells are composed of the following organelles:
Nucleus: The nucleus of the cell functions as the
 genome and genetic information storage for the cell,
containing all the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"] DNA organized in the form of
chromosomes. It is surrounded by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_envelope"] nuclear envelope,
which includes nuclear pores allowing for the
transportation of proteins between the inside and outside
of the nucleus.[14] This is also the site for replication of
DNA as well as transcription of DNA to RNA. Afterwards,
the RNA is modified and transported out to the cytosol to
be translated to protein.[15] 
A diagram of an animal cell
Nucleolus: This structure is within the nucleus, usually dense and spherical in shape. It is
the site of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis, which is needed for ribosomal assembly.
 Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): This functions to synthesize, store, and secrete proteins to the
Golgi apparatus.[16] Structurally, the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes
found throughout the cell and connected to the nucleus. The membranes are slightly
different from cell to cell and a cell's function determines the size and structure of the ER.[17]
Page 4
Mitochondria: Commonly known as the powerhouse of the cell is a double membrane bound
cell organelle.[18] This functions for the production of energy or ATP within the cell.
Specifically, this is the place where the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle for the production of NADH
and FADH occurs. Afterwards, these products are used within the electron transport chain
(ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation for the final production of ATP.[19]
 Golgi apparatus: This functions to further process, package, and secrete the proteins to their
destination. The proteins contain a signal sequence that allows the Golgi apparatus to
recognize and direct it to the correct place. Golgi apparatus also produce [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"] glycoproteins and
glycolipids.[20]
Lysosome: The lysosome functions to degrade material brought in from the outside of the
cell or old organelles. This contains many acid hydrolases, proteases, nucleases, and
lipases, which break down the various molecules. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"] Autophagy is the process of degradation
through lysosomes which occurs when a vesicle buds off from the ER and engulfs the
material, then, attaches and fuses with the lysosome to allow the material to be degraded.[21]
Ribosomes: Functions to translate RNA to protein. it serves as a site of protein synthesis.[22]
Cytoskeleton: Cytoskeleton is a structure that helps to maintain the shape and general
organization of the cytoplasm. It anchors organelles within the cells and makes up the
structure and stability of the cell. The cytoskeleton is composed of three principal types of
protein filaments: actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules, which are held
together and linked to subcellular organelles and the plasma membrane by a variety of
accessory proteins.[23]
 Cell membrane: The cell membrane can be described as a phospholipid bilayer and is also
consisted of lipids and proteins.[12] Because the inside of the bilayer is hydrophobic and in
order for molecules to participate in reactions within the cell, they need to be able to cross
this membrane layer to get into the cell via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure"] osmotic pressure, diffusion, concentration
gradients, and membrane channels.[24]
Centrioles: Function to produce spindle fibers which are used to separate chromosomes
during cell division.
Eukaryotic cells may also be composed of the following molecular components:
Chromatin: This makes up [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"] chromosomes and is a mixture of DNA with various proteins.
Cilia: They help to propel substances and can also be used for sensory purposes.[25]
Cell metabolism
Cell metabolism is necessary for the production of energy for the cell and therefore its survival and includes
many pathways. For [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration"] cellular respiration, once glucose is available, glycolysis occurs within the cytosol of
the cell to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate undergoes decarboxylation using the multi-enzyme complex to form
acetyl coA which can readily be used in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle"] TCA cycle to produce NADH and FADH2. These products
are involved in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transport_chain"] electron transport chain to ultimately form a proton gradient across the inner
 mitochondrial membrane. This gradient can then drive the production of ATP and H2O during oxidative
phosphorylation.[26] Metabolism in plant cells includes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"] photosynthesis which is simply the exact opposite
of respiration as it ultimately produces molecules of glucose.
Cell signaling
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"]
Page 5
 Cell signaling or cell communication is important for cell regulation and for cells to process information
from the environment and respond accordingly. Signaling can occur through direct cell contact or
endocrine, paracrine, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signaling"] autocrine signaling. Direct cell-cell contact is when a receptor on a cell binds a
molecule that is attached to the membrane of another cell. Endocrine signaling occurs through molecules
secreted into the bloodstream. Paracrine signaling uses molecules diffusing between two cells to
communicate. Autocrine is a cell sending a signal to itself by secreting a molecule that binds to a receptor
on its surface. Forms of communication can be through:
 Ion channels: Can be of different types such as voltage or ligand gated ion channels. They
allow for the outflow and inflow of molecules and ions.
 G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR): Is widely recognized to contain seven transmembrane
domains. The ligand binds on the extracellular domain and once the ligand binds, this
signals a guanine exchange factor to convert GDP to GTP and activate the G-α subunit. G-α
can target other proteins such as adenyl cyclase or phospholipase C, which ultimately
produce secondary messengers such as cAMP, Ip3, DAG, and calcium. These secondary
messengers function to amplify signals and can target ion channels or other enzymes. One
example for amplification of a signal is cAMP binding to and activating PKA by removing the
regulatory subunits and releasing the catalytic subunit. The catalytic subunit has a nuclear
localization sequence which prompts it to go into the nucleus and phosphorylate other
proteins to either repress or activate gene activity.[26]
 Receptor tyrosine kinases: Bind growth factors, further promoting the tyrosine on the
intracellular portion of the protein to cross phosphorylate. The phosphorylated tyrosine
becomes a landing pad for proteins containing an SH2 domain allowing for the activation of
Ras and the involvement of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"] MAP kinase pathway.[27]
Growth and development
Eukaryotic cell cycle
Cells are the foundation of all organisms
and are the fundamental units of life. The
growth and development of cells are
essential for the maintenance of the host
and survival of the organism. For this
process, the cell goes through the steps
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"] cell cycle and development which
involves cell growth, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"] DNA replication,
 cell division, regeneration, and cell
death.
The cell cycle is divided into four distinct
phases: G1, S, G2, and M. The G phase
– which is the cell growth phase – makes
up approximately 95% of the cycle. The
proliferation of cells is instigated by
progenitors. All cells start out in an
identical form and can essentially
become any type of cells. Cell signaling
such as induction can influence nearby
cells to determinate the type of cell it will
become. Moreover, this allows cells of 
The process of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"] cell division in the animal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"] cell cycle
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle#Phases"]
Page 6
the same type to aggregate and form tissues, then organs, and ultimately systems. The G1, G2, and S phase
(DNA replication, damage and repair) are considered to be the interphase portion of the cycle, while the M
phase (mitosis) is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"] cell division portion of the cycle. Mitosis is composed of many stages which include,
prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis, respectively. The ultimate result of mitosis is
the formation of two identical daughter cells.
The cell cycle is regulated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"] cell cycle checkpoints, by a series of signaling factors and complexes such as
cyclins, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase"] cyclin-dependent kinase, and p53. When the cell has completed its growth process and if it is found
to be damaged or altered, it undergoes cell death, either by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"] apoptosis or necrosis, to eliminate the threat it
can cause to the organism's survival.[28]
Cell mortality, cell lineage immortality
The ancestry of each present day cell presumably traces back, in an unbroken lineage for over 3 billion
years to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"] origin of life. It is not actually cells that are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality"] immortal but multi-generational cell lineages.[29]
The immortality of a cell lineage depends on the maintenance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"] cell division potential. This potential may
be lost in any particular lineage because of cell damage, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"] terminal differentiation as occurs in nerve cells, or
programmed cell death (apoptosis) during development. Maintenance of cell division potential over
successive generations depends on the avoidance and the accurate repair of cellular damage, particularly
 DNA damage. In sexual organisms, continuity of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"] germline depends on the effectiveness of processes
for avoiding DNA damage and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"] repairing those DNA damages that do occur. Sexual processes in
eukaryotes, as well as in prokaryotes, provide an opportunity for effective repair of DNA damages in the
germ line by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_recombination"] homologous recombination.[29][30]
Cell cycle phases
The cell cycle is a four-stage process that a cell goes through as it develops and divides. It includes Gap 1
(G1), synthesis (S), Gap 2 (G2), and mitosis (M).The cell either restarts the cycle from G1 or leaves the
cycle through G0 after completing the cycle. The cell can progress from G0 through terminal
differentiation.
The interphase refers to the phases of the cell cycle that occur between one mitosis and the next, and
includes G1, S, and G2.
G1 phase
The size of the cell grows.
The contents of cells are replicated.
S phase
Replication of DNA
The cell replicates each of the 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).
G2 phase
The cell multiplies.
Page 7
In preparation for cell division, organelles and proteins form.
M phase
After mitosis, cytokinesis occurs (cell separation)
Formation of two daughter cells that are identical
G0 phase
These cells leave G1 and enter G0, a resting stage. A cell in G0 is doing its job without actively preparing
to divide.[31]
Pathology
The scientific branch that studies and diagnoses diseases on the cellular level is called cytopathology.
Cytopathology is generally used on samples of free cells or tissue fragments, in contrast to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"] pathology
branch of histopathology, which studies whole tissues. Cytopathology is commonly used to investigate
diseases involving a wide range of body sites, often to aid in the diagnosis of cancer but also in the
diagnosis of some infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions. For example, a common
application of cytopathology is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pap_smear"] Pap smear, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"] screening test used to detect [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"] cervical cancer, and
 precancerous cervical lesions that may lead to cervical cancer.[32]
Cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair system
The cell cycle is composed of a number of well-ordered, consecutive stages that result in cellular division.
The fact that cells do not begin the next stage until the last one is finished, is a significant element of cell
cycle regulation. Cell cycle checkpoints are characteristics that constitute an excellent monitoring strategy
for accurate cell cycle and divisions. Cdks, associated cyclin counterparts, protein kinases, and
phosphatases regulate cell growth and division from one stage to another.[33] The cell cycle is controlled by
the temporal activation of Cdks, which is governed by cyclin partner interaction, phosphorylation by
particular protein kinases, and de-phosphorylation by Cdc25 family phosphatases. In response to DNA
damage, a cell's DNA repair reaction is a cascade of signaling pathways that leads to checkpoint
engagement, regulates, the repairing mechanism in DNA, cell cycle alterations, and apoptosis. Numerous
biochemical structures, as well as processes that detect damage in DNA, are ATM and ATR, which induce
the DNA repair checkpoints[34]
The cell cycle is a sequence of activities in which cell organelles are duplicated and subsequently separated
into daughter cells with precision. There are major events that happen during a cell cycle. The processes
that happen in the cell cycle include cell development, replication and segregation of chromosomes.  The
cell cycle checkpoints are surveillance systems that keep track of the cell cycle's integrity, accuracy, and
chronology. Each checkpoint serves as an alternative cell cycle endpoint, wherein the cell's parameters are
examined and only when desirable characteristics are fulfilled does the cell cycle advance through the
distinct steps.The cell cycle's goal is to precisely copy each organism's DNA and afterwards equally split
the cell and its components between the two new cells. Four main stages occur in the eukaryotes. In G1,
the cell is usually active and continues to grow rapidly, while in G2, the cell growth continues while protein
molecules become ready for separation. These are not dormant times; they are when cells gain mass,
integrate growth factor receptors, establish a replicated genome, and prepare for chromosome segregation.
DNA replication is restricted to a separate Synthesis in eukaryotes, which is also known as the S-phase.
Page 8
During mitosis, which is also known as the M-phase, the segregation of the chromosomes occur.[35] DNA,
like every other molecule, is capable of undergoing a wide range of chemical reactions. Modifications in
DNA's sequence, on the other hand, have a considerably bigger impact than modifications in other cellular
constituents like RNAs or proteins because DNA acts as a permanent copy of the cell genome. When
erroneous nucleotides are incorporated during DNA replication, mutations can occur. The majority of DNA
damage is fixed by removing the defective bases and then re-synthesizing the excised area. On the other
hand, some DNA lesions can be mended by reversing the damage, which may be a more effective method
of coping with common types of DNA damage. Only a few forms of DNA damage are mended in this
fashion, including pyrimidine dimers caused by ultraviolet (UV) light changed by the insertion of methyl or
ethyl groups at the purine ring's O6 position.[36]
Mitochondrial membrane dynamics
Mitochondria are commonly referred to as the cell's "powerhouses" because of their capacity to effectively
produce ATP which is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis and metabolism. Moreover, researchers
have gained a better knowledge of mitochondria's significance in cell biology because of the discovery of
cell signaling pathways by mitochondria which are crucial platforms for cell function regulation such as
apoptosis. Its physiological adaptability is strongly linked to the cell mitochondrial channel's ongoing
reconfiguration through a range of mechanisms known as mitochondrial membrane dynamics, which
include endomembrane fusion and fragmentation (separation) as well as ultrastructural membrane
remodeling. As a result, mitochondrial dynamics regulate and frequently choreograph not only metabolic
but also complicated cell signaling processes such as cell pluripotent stem cells, proliferation, maturation,
aging, and mortality. Mutually, post-translational alterations of mitochondrial apparatus and the
development of transmembrane contact sites among mitochondria and other structures, which both have the
potential to link signals from diverse routes that affect mitochondrial membrane dynamics substantially,[35]
Mitochondria are wrapped by two membranes: an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and an outer
mitochondrial membrane (OMM), each with a distinctive function and structure, which parallels their dual
role as cellular powerhouses and signaling organelles. The inner mitochondrial membrane divides the
mitochondrial lumen into two parts: the inner border membrane, which runs parallel to the OMM, and the
cristae, which are deeply twisted, multinucleated invaginations that give room for surface area enlargement
and house the mitochondrial respiration apparatus. The outer mitochondrial membrane, on the other hand,
is soft and permeable. It, therefore, acts as a foundation for cell signaling pathways to congregate, be
deciphered, and be transported into mitochondria. Furthermore, the OMM connects to other cellular
organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomes, endosomes, and the plasma membrane.
Mitochondria play a wide range of roles in cell biology, which is reflected in their morphological diversity.
Ever since the beginning of the mitochondrial study, it has been well documented that mitochondria can
have a variety of forms, with both their general and ultra-structural morphology varying greatly among
cells, during the cell cycle, and in response to metabolic or cellular cues. Mitochondria can exist as
independent organelles or as part of larger systems; they can also be unequally distributed in the cytosol
through regulated mitochondrial transport and placement to meet the cell's localized energy requirements.
Mitochondrial dynamics refers to the adaptive and variable aspect of mitochondria, including their shape
and subcellular distribution.[35]
Autophagy
Autophagy is a self-degradative mechanism that regulates energy sources during growth and reaction to
dietary stress. Autophagy also cleans up after itself, clearing aggregated proteins, cleaning damaged
structures including mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum and eradicating intracellular infections.
Additionally, autophagy has antiviral and antibacterial roles within the cell, and it is involved at the
beginning of distinctive and adaptive immune responses to viral and bacterial contamination. Some viruses
Page 9
include virulence proteins that prevent autophagy, while others utilize autophagy elements for intracellular
development or cellular splitting.[37] Macro autophagy, micro autophagy, and chaperon-mediated
autophagy are the three basic types of autophagy. When macro autophagy is triggered, an exclusion
membrane incorporates a section of the cytoplasm, generating the autophagosome, a distinctive double-
membraned organelle. The autophagosome then joins the lysosome to create an autolysosome, with
lysosomal enzymes degrading the components. In micro autophagy, the lysosome or vacuole engulfs a
piece of the cytoplasm by invaginating or protruding the lysosomal membrane to enclose the cytosol or
organelles. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone-mediated_autophagy"] chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) protein quality assurance by digesting oxidized and
altered proteins under stressful circumstances and supplying amino acids through protein denaturation.[38]
Autophagy is the primary intrinsic degradative system for peptides, fats, carbohydrates, and other cellular
structures. In both physiologic and stressful situations, this cellular progression is vital for upholding the
correct cellular balance. Autophagy instability leads to a variety of illness symptoms, including
inflammation, biochemical disturbances, aging, and neurodegenerative, due to its involvement in
controlling cell integrity. The modification of the autophagy-lysosomal networks is a typical hallmark of
many neurological and muscular illnesses. As a result, autophagy has been identified as a potential strategy
for the prevention and treatment of various disorders. Many of these disorders are prevented or improved
by consuming polyphenol in the meal. As a result, natural compounds with the ability to modify the
autophagy mechanism are seen as a potential therapeutic option.[39] The creation of the double membrane
(phagophore), which would be known as nucleation, is the first step in macro-autophagy. The phagophore
approach indicates dysregulated polypeptides or defective organelles that come from the cell membrane,
Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. With the conclusion of the autophagocyte, the
phagophore's enlargement comes to an end. The auto-phagosome combines with the lysosomal vesicles to
formulate an auto-lysosome that degrades the encapsulated substances, referred to as phagocytosis.[40]
