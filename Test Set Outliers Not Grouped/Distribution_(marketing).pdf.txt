Distribution (marketing)
 Distribution (or place) is one of the four elements of the marketing
mix. Distribution is the process of making a product or service
available for the consumer or business user who needs it. This can be
done directly by the producer or service provider or using indirect
channels with distributors or intermediaries. The other three elements
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix"] marketing mix are product, pricing, and promotion.
Decisions about distribution need to be taken in line with a company's
overall strategic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_statement"] vision and mission. Developing a coherent distribution
plan is a central component of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning"] strategic planning. At the strategic level,
there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective
and exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries
selected largely depend on the strategic approach. The overall
distribution channel should add value to the consumer.

Definition
 Distribution is fundamentally concerned with ensuring that products reach target customers in the most
direct and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_efficiency"] cost-efficient manner. In the case of services, distribution is principally concerned with access.[1]
Although distribution, as a concept, is relatively simple, in practice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_management_system"] distribution management may involve a
Page 2
diverse range of activities and disciplines including detailed logistics, transportation, warehousing, storage,
 inventory management as well as channel management including selection of channel members and
rewarding distributors.[2]
Distribution strategies
Prior to designing a distribution system, the planner needs to determine what the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_channel"] distribution channel is to
achieve in broad terms. The overall approach to distributing products or services depends on a number of
factors including the type of product, especially perishability; the market served; the geographic scope of
operations and the firm's overall mission and vision. The process of setting out a broad statement of the
aims and objectives of a distribution channel is a strategic level decision.
Strategically, there are three approaches to distribution:[3]
Mass distribution (also known as an intensive
distribution): When products are destined for a mass
market, the marketer will seek out intermediaries that
appeal to a broad market base. For example, snack
foods and drinks are sold via a wide variety of outlets
 including supermarkets, convenience stores, vending
machines, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafeteria"] cafeterias and others. The choice of
distribution outlet is skewed towards those that can  In an intensive distribution approach,

efficient manner.
example, a manufacturer of premium electrical goods
may choose to deal with department stores and
independent outlets that can provide added value service level required to support the
product. Dr. Scholl orthopedic sandals, for example, only sell their product through
pharmacies because this type of intermediary supports the desired therapeutic positioning of
the product. Some of the prestige brands of cosmetics and skincare, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est%C3%A9e_Lauder_Companies"] Estee Lauder,
 Jurlique and Clinique, insist that sales staff are trained to use the product range. The
manufacturer will only allow trained clinicians to sell their products.
Exclusive distribution: In an exclusive distribution approach, a manufacturer chooses to deal
with one intermediary or one type of intermediary. The advantage of an exclusive approach
is that the manufacturer retains greater control over the distribution process. In exclusive
arrangements, the distributor is expected to work closely with the manufacturer and add
value to the product through service level, after sales care or client support services. Another
definition of exclusive arrangement is an agreement between a supplier and a retailer
granting the retailer exclusive rights within a specific geographic area to carry the supplier's
product.[4]

distribution 
Definition
The producer's products are stocked in the majority of outlets.[5] This strategy is common for mass-
produced products such as basic supplies, snack foods, magazines and soft drink beverages.[6]
The producer relies on a few intermediaries to carry their product.[5] This strategy is commonly
observed for more specialised goods that are carried through specialist dealers, for example, brands
of craft tools, or large appliances.
The producer selects only very few intermediaries.[5] Exclusive distribution occurs where the seller
agrees to allow a single retailer the right to sell the manufacturer's products. This strategy is typical
of luxury goods retailers such as Gucci.
Push vs pull strategy
In consumer markets, another key strategic level decision is whether to use a push or pull strategy. In a push
strategy, the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and
wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will
purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a pull strategy, the marketer promotes the product
directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it
through the distribution channel.[7] The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for
advertising and promotion. In a push strategy, the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and
sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions,
and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use of consumer advertising and sales
promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers,
magazines, television, and radio.[8]
Channels and intermediaries
 Distribution of products takes place by means of a marketing
channel, also known as a distribution channel. A marketing channel
is the people, organizations, and activities necessary to transfer the
ownership of goods from the point of production to the point of
consumption. It is the way products get to the end-user, the
consumer. This is mostly accomplished through merchant retailers
or wholesalers or, in the international context, by importers. In
certain specialist markets, agents or brokers may become involved
in the marketing channel.
Typical intermediaries involved in distribution include: 
A wholesale fish market at Haikou,
New Port
Wholesaler: A merchant intermediary who sells chiefly
to retailers, other merchants, or industrial, institutional, and commercial users mainly for
resale or business use. The transactions are B2B (Business to Business). Wholesalers
typically sell in large quantities. (Wholesalers, by definition, do not deal directly with the
public).[9]
Retailer: A merchant intermediary who sells direct to the public. There are many different
types of retail outlet - from hypermarts and supermarkets to small, independent stores. The
transactions in this case are B2C (Business to Customer).
Agent: An intermediary who is authorized to act for a principal in order to facilitate
exchange. Unlike merchant wholesalers and retailers, agents do not take title to goods, but
simply put buyers and sellers together. Agents are typically paid via commissions by the
Page 4
principal. For example, travel agents are paid a commission of around 15% for each booking
made with an airline or hotel operator.
Jobber: A special type of wholesaler, typically one who operates on a small scale and sells
only to retailers or institutions. For example, rack jobbers are small independent wholesalers
who operate from a truck, supplying convenience stores with snack foods and drinks on a
regular basis.[10]
Channel design
A firm can design any number of channels they require to reach
customers efficiently and effectively. Channels can be distinguished
by the number of intermediaries between producer and
consumer.[5] If there are no intermediaries then this is known as a
zero-level distribution system or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_marketing"] direct marketing. A level one
(sometimes called one-tier) channel has a single intermediary. A
level two (alternatively a two-tier) channel has two intermediaries,
and so on. This flow is typically represented as being manufacturer
to retailer to consumer, but may involve other types of
intermediaries. In practice, distribution systems for perishable goods 
Types of distribution systems
tend to be shorter - direct or single intermediary, because of the
need to reduce the time a product spends in transit or in storage. In other cases, distribution systems can
become quite complex involving many levels and different types of intermediaries.
Channel mix
In practice, many organizations use a mix of different channels; a direct sales force may call on larger
customers. This may be complemented with other agents to cover smaller customers and prospects. When a
single organization uses a variety of different channels to reach its markets, this is known as a multi-channel
distribution network. In addition, online retailing or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_commerce"] e-commerce is leading to disintermediation, the removal
of intermediaries from a supply chain. Retailing via smartphone or m-commerce is also a growth area.
Managing channels
The firm's marketing department needs to design the most suitable channels for the firm's products, then
select appropriate channel members or intermediaries. An organization may need to train staff of
intermediaries and motivate the intermediary to sell the firm's products. The firm should monitor the
channel's performance over time and modify the channel to enhance performance.
Channel motivation
To motivate intermediaries the firm can use positive actions, such as offering higher margins to the
intermediary, special deals, premiums and allowances for advertising or display.[5] On the other hand,
negative actions may be necessary, such as threatening to cut back on margin, or hold back delivery of
product. Care must be exercised when considering negative actions as these may fall foul of regulations and
can contribute to a public backlash and a public relations disaster.
Channel conflict
Page 5
Channel conflict can arise when one intermediary's actions prevent
another intermediary from achieving their objectives.[5] Vertical
channel conflict occurs between the levels within a channel, and
horizontal channel conflict occurs between intermediaries at the
same level within a channel. Channel conflict is a perennial
problem. There are risks that a powerful channel member may
coordinate the interests of the channel for personal gain.[11]
Trends in distribution
Channel switching 
Harrod's food hall, a major retailer in
London
Channel-switching (not to be confused with zapping or channel
surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching from one type
of channel intermediary to a different type of intermediary for their
purchases. Examples include switching from brick-and-mortar
stores to online catalogues and e-commerce providers; switching
from grocery stores to convenience stores or switching from top tier
department stores to mass market discount outlets.[12] A number of
factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the
growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of
 Category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as
changes in the legal or statutory environment. For instance, in
Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws 
The advent of "category killers",
such as Australia's Officeworks, has
contributed to an increase in channel
switching behaviour.
prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers
are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards
supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary
medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.[13]
For the consumer, channel switching offers a more diverse shopping experience. However, marketers need
to be alert to channel switching because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel
switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing
fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be
found at cheaper prices, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply
because it is more convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping).[14] As
a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel
retailing.[15]
Customer value
The emergence of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-dominant_logic"] service-dominant logic perspective has focused scholarly attention on how distribution
networks serve to create customer value and to consider how value is co-created by all the players within
the distribution chain, including the value created by customers themselves.[16] This emphasis on value-
creation is contributing to a change in terminology surrounding distribution processes; "distribution
networks" are often termed value-chains while "distribution centers" are often termed customer fulfillment
centers. For example, the retail giant Amazon, which utilizes both direct online distribution alongside bricks
and mortar stores, now calls its distribution centers "customer fulfillment centers".[17] Although the term,
"customer fulfillment center" has been criticized on the grounds that it is a neologism, its use is becoming
increasingly mainstream as it slowly makes its way into introductory marketing textbooks.[18]

Disintermediation
Disintermediation occurs when manufacturers or service providers eliminate intermediaries from the
distribution network and deal directly with purchasers. Disintermediation is found in industries where
radically new types of channel intermediaries displace traditional distributors. The widespread public
acceptance of online shopping has been a major trigger for disintermediation in some industries. Certain
types of traditional intermediaries are dropping by the wayside.[19]
