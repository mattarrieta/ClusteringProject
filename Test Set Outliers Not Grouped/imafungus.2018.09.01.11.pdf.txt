Abstract: The large number of species still to be discovered in fungi, together with an exponentially growing number
of environmental sequences that cannot be linked to known taxa, has fuelled the idea that it might be necessary to
formally name fungi on the basis of sequence data only. Here we object to this idea due to several shortcomings

INTRODUCTION
Fungi are highly diverse, with an estimated number of up to 6
Million species (Taylor et al. 2014), of which far less than 5 %
have been described to date. While nothing is known about
most of these missing species, environmental sequencing
studies have revealed many sequences that currently cannot
be associated with any described species. As a consequence, 
there has been the temptation to describe these species on
grounds of only their sequences, which have been proposed
to serve as substitutes for type specimens of new taxa
(Hawksworth et al. 2016).  In this manuscript we outline
ten reasons why we feel that a nomenclature based on
sequences is not useful and applicable to fungi anytime soon, 
emphasizing potential pitfalls and unintended detrimental
effects of such an approach. 
TEN REASONS
1. The resolution of barcoding loci, especially
ITS, varies among different groups
The idea of using sequence similarity as a measure of
GH¿QLQJ WD[D LV WHPSWLQJ DQG GXH WR WKH ODFN RI RWKHU UHDGLO\
available characteristics, bacteriologists have embraced this
concept for the delimitation of bacterial taxa (Stackebrandt et
al. 2002), although, importantly, there are several additional
requirements needed for formally naming bacterial taxa
according to the latest version of the ,QWHUQDWLRQDO &RGH RI
Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (Parker et al. 2015). To be
useful in the discrimination of species throughout all the
diversity of a given organismic group, sequence divergence
in DNA barcoding loci needs to be strongly correlated to the
genetic diversity that is needed to provide effective barriers

bacteria (Fraser et al. 2009), it certainly does not for fungi. 
The universal barcode for fungi are the internal transcribed
spacers (ITS),  regulatory, non-structural RNA transcripts
with a common core of secondary structure (Schultz et
al. 2005, Schoch et al. 2012). The ITS regions are rather

conserved in many species groups, in particular within the
Sordariomycetes and other classes of Ascomycota (Stadler
et al. 2014b).  However, they may vary strongly in other
groups, such as some groups of downy mildews (Thines
2007), rust fungi (Aime et al. 2017) and the Fusarium fujikuroi 
complex, in which species have two divergent ITS2 types
(O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997). This can lead to two potential
W\SHV RI HUURU $V H[HPSOL¿HG E\ WKH JHQXV Daldinia (Stadler
et al. 2014b), entire species groups that that are very different
in terms of ecology, morphology, and biochemistry but share
very similar ITS sequences would be lumped together into
a single species if a unique ITS sequence were already
acceptable as a type. Conversely, in other species there are
little constraints to variation in some loop regions of the ITS, 
leading to different sequence types that could be erroneously
interpreted as separate species.
2. There is a high risk of introducing artefacts
as new species
Most complete ITS sequences are still produced by
conventional dideoxy sequencing (“Sanger” sequencing), but
given the routine nature of barcoding fungi, little effort is often
put into quality control of the sequences by visual editing or by
sequencing the complementary strand (Janda & Abbott 2007),
as evidenced by an increase of variant bases in sequences
deposited in public databases towards either end of the
sequences, where low quality base-calls are usually present. 
As some variants are more likely to occur, e.g. homopolymer
errors or wrong base-calls after GC-rich stretches, these
might look like actual sequence types. In addition, most
widely used polymerases, such as the Taq DNA polymerase
have a high rate of incorporating wrong nucleotides, which
is usually no problem in direct sequencing, but problematic
when sequencing clones or when using high throughput
sequencing, which exposes these errors (Oliver et al. 2015).
As the vast majority of previously uncharacterised species is
prone to be sequenced in screens from cultures derived from
environmental samples (Glynou et al. 2016). These usually do
QRW IRFXV RQ WD[RQRP\ EXW MXVW RQ D YHU\ URXJK FODVVL¿FDWLRQ
and consequently, quality control is not necessarily focussed on
the DNA sequences generated due to the large amount of data. 
In addition, PCR can produce chimeric sequences (Hughes et
al. 2015), especially when DNA derived from multiple species
is used (e.g. environmental DNA), by the attachment of non-
homologous, incompletely synthesised PCR products to each
other. There are approaches to detect such chimeras (Edgar
et al. 2011, Nilsson et al. 2015), but especially when sequence
GLYHUJHQFH LV RQO\ PRGHUDWH ¿OWHULQJ LV GLI¿FXOW :KHQ KLJK
throughput sequencing is used for barcoding, additional
problems arise, e.g. additional chimera formation during
bridge-PCR in Illumina sequencing (Coissac et al. 2012, 
Schnell et al. 2015). The situation is further complicated by
the potential presence of multiple divergent ITS copies within
JHQRPHV RI RQH VSHFLHV RU DV VKRZQ E\ 3HUãRK et al. (2009) 
and Stadler et al. (2014a), even among single spore isolates
from the same perithecium in a heterokaryotic setting. Such
variations may be due to degenerate copies (Won & Renner
2005, Harpke & Peterson 2008), failure to converge into a
single canonical ITS version (Li et al. 2013), potentially with
multiple polymorphic positions, or the maintenance of multiple 
rDNA cistrons (Ko & Jung 2002, Wörheide et al. 2004, Lindner
& Banik 2010, Harrington et al. 2014, Kijpornyongpan &
Aime 2016). All of these issues are prone to produce artefact

as the type for a species.
3. There is no consensus regarding the data
type or amount needed for species delimitation
As least some of the issues mentioned thus far, especially
those pertaining to ITS sequences, could probably be
addressed by using high quality sequences of additional loci, 
but currently there is little consensus regarding how much
sequence data are needed to reliably identify and delimit a
species or a corresponding OTU and how it should be treated
(Creer et al. 2016, Hibbett 2016a, b, Kõljalg et al. 2016). While
VRPHWLPHV HYHQ IUDFWLRQV RI ,76 RU ,76 PLJKW EH VXI¿FLHQW
for resolution at the species level (Miller et al. 2016), often it
will be necessary to sequence multiple loci for proper species
delimitation (Stadler et al. 2014a, Choi et al. 2015). While
multigene genotyping has become standard in some groups
(Choi et al. 2015, Choi & Thines 2015, Kruse et al. 2017a, 
Wendt et al. 2018), others still rely mostly on ITS because

E $OVR WKH NLQG RI ORFL WKDW FDQ EH DPSOL¿HG E\ XQLYHUVDO
primers differs largely among groups. While in some, actin
might amplify well (Voigt & Wöstemeyer 2000), others only work
for some ribosome-associated proteins (Matheny et al. 2002, 
Stielow et al. 2015). This makes a consensus with respect to
ZKLFK ORFL WR XVH GLI¿FXOW (YHQ D UHFRPPHQGDWLRQ ZLWK UHVSHFW
to how many nucleotides should be sequenced cannot be
made, as mutation rates differ between loci and organism
groups. If it were argued that a single nucleotide difference
would be enough to delimit species, there would be a high risk
RI LQWURGXFLQJ DUWL¿FLDO VKDGRZ WD[D RQ WKH EDVLV RI DUWHIDFWV
+RZHYHU LQ RUGHU WR ¿QG WHQ RU  GLIIHUHQW QXFOHRWLGHV
thousands of nucleotides would need to be sequenced in
some groups (Choi et al. 2015). But, as this would most likely
require a specimen, this would challenge the whole idea of
sequence-based types, as species based on these are meant
to be introduced in the absence of a specimen (Hawksworth
et al. 2016). As genomes are becoming more widespread, 
they might even become commonplace when new taxa
are introduced in the future, similar to recommendations in
bacteriology (Rosello-Móra & Amann 2014). However, due to
the repeat nature of the ribosomal DNA cistrons, the regions
currently used for barcoding are often not well-assembled or
even masked during repeat masking steps so that they are
seemingly absent from annotated genomes.
In addition, there is also no consensus regarding the type
of sequence data that should be acceptable. It could be argued
that high quality short fragments of a few hundred base-pairs

read sequencers, but also long reads from single molecule
sequencing could be seen as acceptable if they contain
enough high quality base-calls, despite intermittent low quality
stretches. In addition, there are also several derived sequence
data types (assembled or clustered reads), which have their
own complexities (see point 7) but are seen as acceptable
sequence data for species discovery and naming by some
authors (Hawksworth et al. 2016, Jagielski et al. 2016).

Reasons against a sequence-based nomenclature
4. Voucherless data are not reproducible
Reproducibility and testability are essential in science (Popper
1968, Cassey & Blackburn 2006). The value of a physical
specimen, which is a requirement for valid publication of
preservable fungi and organisms treated as such since
2007, is that it can be assessed by other researchers for
testing the species hypothesis (Bradley et al. 2014). In other
words, a voucher specimen serves as the embodiment of
a species hypothesis, and contains a suite of characters
that can be tested, evaluated, and reinterpreted by future
researchers, including characters (such as DNA sequences
themselves) that may not have been recognized at the time
RI W\SL¿FDWLRQ \HW PD\ EHFRPH FUXFLDO LQ IXWXUH WD[RQRPLF
evaluations. An important concern with respect to sequence-
only types is that they are not reproducible and it would be
impossible to generate additional data for other characters or
loci. However, this might be needed if there are competing
species hypotheses or it would be later determined that the

in a species complex. All of these concerns can only be
addressed if a vouchered specimen is deposited. If such a
specimen is present, the designation of sequence data as
type becomes obsolete. It could be proposed that in the case
of sequence-based species hypotheses from environmental
sequencing a preparation of the environmental sample could
serve as a specimen. However, such specimens would
still not guarantee reproducibility as: (1) the organism from
which the actual sequence was derived might not be in the
preparation; (2) the sequence might still be an artefact (see
also Points 3 and 7); (3) the sequence might have been

parts of the organisms are within the sample; and (4) it has
been shown that there is often no full overlap between two
independent assessments of the same sample, and that
sequence composition strongly varies with the PCR annealing
temperature used (Schmidt et al. 2013).

However, voucherless sequence-based types cannot be
YHUL¿HG RU UHSURGXFHG ± WKH\ KDYH WR EH WDNHQ DV DEVROXWHV
This also means that the species hypothesis they support
cannot be tested, rendering systematic mycology a pseudo-
science. Testability of taxonomic hypotheses due to the
possibility to assess physical type specimens has been one
of the greatest advances in systematic biology, which has
led to an increase in nomenclatural stability, has facilitated
communication, and allowed the reassessment of concepts
when new technologies became available (Singh et al. 2015).
Allowing the requirement that taxonomic hypotheses for
preservable species need to be backed up by a physical type
to be abandoned would be a giant step backward.
6. Sequence-based types are not relatable
Related to Points 4 and 5, characters of specimens listed
in diagnoses or descriptions can always be related to the
specimens from which they have been derived. They do not
stand isolated, but rather are a proxy for the description of 
the entire set of characters of the taxonomic hypothesis they
relate to. Sequence data are just one of many characters of a
species, even though they might be a good starting point for
in-depth investigations (Kekkonen and Hebert 2014). If they
alone were eligible as types, they would stand alone in the way
a specimen would. But in contrast, no additional characters
could be assessed and sequence data do not relate to any

can only be compared to other species sequenced at the
same locus. They would no longer be comparable to species

taxonomic utility and again creating the potential for shadow
taxa. Presently about 120 000 species are acknowledged, but
there are more than 400 000 names (Dayarathne et al. 2016).
Only a mere fraction of the 120 000 accepted species have
DNA sequences deposited. If species were named based
on environmental sequences, and they were given the same
status as species with specimens, the risk would arise that all
ZRUN GRQH EHIRUH WKH ¿UVW '1$ VHTXHQFHV ZHUH GHSRVLWHG
in GenBank, in 1991, would be deliberately ignored. Thus, 
sequence-based naming of species is prone to prohibit careful
research relating DNA data to existing names, and erecting
QXPHURXV QHZ DQG VXSHUÀXRXV QDPHV WKDW DFWXDOO\ EHORQJ WR
species that have already been named, but not yet sequenced. 
Consequently, sequence-based types would be fragments of a
parallel system to which no organismic entity could be related
and which, as such, could not be used as a foundation for
VFLHQWL¿F NQRZOHGJH
7. Sequences of reported OTUs are derived, 
not actual sequences
The whole debate on allowing DNA-sequences as type has
originated from the wish of molecular environmentalists to give
‘proper’ names to the numerous enigmatic OTUs they have
found (Hibbett et al. 2016), which are only known from their
(partial) ITS sequences, but cannot be associated with any
known (and barcoded) species. However, there is a common
misconception that sequences of an operational taxonomic
unit (OTU) correspond to sequences of an actual organism, 
which is not the case (Ryberg 2015, Callahan et al. 2016, 
Selosse et al. 2016). This is because OTUs are usually derived
from computational methods, such as clustering and thus do
not represent primary data (Callahan et al. 2016, Selosse et
al. 2016). In most studies dealing with fungi, either a 99 % or
a 97 % threshold is assumed (Gweon et al. 2015, Vermeulen
et al. 2016, Glynou et al. 2017a, 2018). This means that
VHTXHQFHV VXI¿FLHQWO\ VLPLODU WR PHHW WKH FULWHULD DUH EHLQJ
clustered together and their consensus sequence is being
calculated. In many fungal groups a similarity of 99 %, i.e. 5–6
different nucleotide positions in ITS regions, would encompass
several species (Choi et al. 2015),  while a similarity of
97 % could consequently encompass dozens of species. In
either case, the generation of the consensus sequence is
largely dependent on the amount and divergence of reads and
the kind of sequences in the dataset that is used for clustering, 
EXW LW LV DOVR LQÀXHQFHG E\ WKH FOXVWHULQJ DSSURDFK XVHG 0DKp
et al. 2014). Thus, OTUs depend on the context in which
they are embedded in terms of sampling, PCR, sequencing, 
and clustering methods and are not easily reproducible
(Brown et al. 2015, Oliver et al. 2015, Meisel et al. 2016). In

Even if the most prevalent individual read sequence were taken
DV WKH W\SH IRU D VSHFL¿F 278 DOO WKH SUREOHPV DWWDFKHG WR
such sequences, e.g. the numerous potential artefacts during
PCR and sequencing, remained unresolved. Also, it would be
unclear where to draw boundaries between the different OTUs
as there will always be the potential for overlap between OTUs
if they are derived from rather similar sequences.
8. Sequence-based types favour well-funded
large mycology labs and leave researchers in
developing countries behind
Environmental sequencing can only be pursued by
mycologists with access to laboratories with molecular biology

handling of large datasets. In addition, a large amount of
specialised knowledge in molecular biology and computation
is needed. Therefore, it is not surprising that the vast majority
of environmental sequencing initiatives are run by laboratories
in the richest countries of the world. Apart from all the issues
mentioned so far, allowing DNA sequences as type would
thus create an even larger gap between developing countries
and developed countries, leaving the former behind when
it comes to the discovery of new species. Even in richer
countries, the specialists for certain taxonomic groups can
nowadays only be found among amateur mycologists, who

millions of species predicted to exist (Nilsson et al. 2016). If the
act of publishing a sequence could be seen as the formal act
of introducing a new species, there is a high risk that interest
in the actual discovery of the organism would diminish, as the
discovery of the actual organism would become the equivalent

a few highly prevalent or interesting organisms (Nilsson et
al. 2016). There is already a recent trend wherein many taxa
are described only on the basis of a ‘new’ ITS sequence
by researchers not aware of or neglecting the fact that the
majority of fungal species already described have not been
barcoded (De Beer et al. 2016). There is also the risk that
in systems where quantity in research is valued higher than
quality, massive amounts of names without detailed quality
FKHFNV ZRXOG EH SXEOLVKHG ÀRRGLQJ IXQJDO QRPHQFODWXUH ZLWK
tens of thousands of meaningless names that would need to
be sorted out in future decades or centuries. If it is possible
to publish new species from the computer just on the basis
of a DNA sequence, not only knowledge of the morphology, 
anatomy, chemistry, physiology, life history strategies and
ecology of fungi would lose value, but researchers interested
in organismal mycology might be discouraged to intensely
study and characterise species right from the start, eroding
the foundation on which fungal systematics is built. If all the
‘dark matter’ of the cryptic basal lineages of fungi (Grossart et
al. 2016) would be formally named based on sequence data, 
this would probably also discourage the laborious search for 
these organisms by FISH and other microscopy techniques
(Jones et al. 2011, Lazarus & James 2015, Lepère et al. 
2016, Matsubayashi et al. 2017). Another problematic issue
is that if sequence data were accepted as type, specimens
might be seen as obsolete and only cost-prohibitive museum
REMHFWV DV WKH\ DUH PRUH GLI¿FXOW WR VWRUH FXUDWH DQG
preserve than sequence data. This could herald the end of
fungaria and the decline of culture collections, even though
these might hold the key for substances of unpredictable
value for human welfare, such as antibiotics, therapeutically
relevant metabolites, as well as platform chemicals and
enzymes for biotechnology (McClusky et al. 2010, Boundy-
Mills 2012, Sette et al. 2013). In groups such as Ascomycota 
that comprise numerous species that are rich producers of
novel secondary metabolites (Helaly et al. 2018), the non-
mycologists studying the chemistry of the species often
tend to assign the species or genus name according to
the most similar DNA sequence found in a BLAST search. 
This has led to manifold inaccuracies, which has prompted
Raja et al. (2017) to encourage a more accurate treatment
RI WKH WD[RQRP\ RI WKH VSHFLHV $ '1$ EDVHG W\SL¿FDWLRQ
would send the wrong signal also to the scientists of other
communities who, for a correct interpretation of their results, 
rely on mycologists providing sound species concepts using
polyphasic methodology.
10. An introduction of sequence-based no-
menclature is impossible at present due to the
fast pace at which sequencing technologies

older than a dozen years (Shokralla et al. 2012), and is still
moving quickly, with new technologies evolving and others
becoming obsolete (Goodwin et al. 2016, Valentini et al. 
2016).  The initially revolutionary 454 technology is now
virtually obsolete, while long-read sequencing currently
enables read lengths of dozens of kilobases, albeit currently
with higher error rates (Kennedy et al. 2018). From the very
beginning, high throughput sequencing has been used to
characterise microbial and fungal communities on the basis
of environmental DNA (Hamady et al. 2008, Buée et al. 2009, 
Jumpponen and Jones 2009). Initially, short barcodes were
commonly used (Nilsson et al. 2011), with the recent chemistry

possible to obtain complete ITS sequences (Birol et al. 2013).
Very recently complete rDNA regions have been sequenced

possible in the near future, but whole genome sequencing
from environmental samples seems to be within reach during
the next decade. Right now, there is little agreement on best
practices and techniques for sequencing and data handling, 
which is no wonder, given the fast turnover of sequencing
technologies and software packages to deal with the huge
amounts of data associated with high throughput sequencing. 
Thus, it seems premature to devise any rules on how to
describe taxa based on sequence data alone. This might
become a useful approach when whole genomes become
available, even though many of the points mentioned above
