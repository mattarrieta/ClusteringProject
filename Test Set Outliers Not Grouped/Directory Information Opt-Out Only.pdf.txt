The district has designated a student’s name, address, grade level, honors and awards, photograph (including use of student
photographs in school district publications, in school district social media, on the school district’s website, and in the news
media), video or film of students when filmed by the district for educational purposes or for promotional use or filmed by
news media, and major field of study as directory information. Photos and video that would generally be considered harmful
or an invasion of privacy if disclosed are not directory information. The district has also designated a student’s date of birth as

ment. This opt-out request will remain in effect for the current school year only.
