PHOTOGRAPHY/VIDEO OPT-OUT FORM
(Complete and return this form ONLY IF YOU DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION for your student to
appear in possible school publicity images or videos, including postings on the school or district website.)
There are many activities and accomplishments that take place in our schools which the Santa Barbara
Unified School District feels are positive, newsworthy and of interest to the community. District
representatives and program partners will, from time to time, use still photography or videography for the
purpose of highlighting student achievements or chronicling classroom/school activities. Those images
may be used in informational newsletters, school brochures and other printed material published by the
Santa Barbara Unified School District. It is possible that those images might be used on school and/or
district web sites. They may also be submitted to the news media for possible publication. 
If, for any reason, you do not want your child’s likeness to be used by the Santa Barbara Unified School
District or by the news media for the purpose of positive publicity about school activities or student
achievement, please fill out this form and return to the school’s secretary. 
This form only applies to the current school year. This form only applies to classroom activities or
school events that are not already open to the public. Public events such as sports events, theater
productions, etc. are considered open to the public and outside photographers and videographers
are not governed by district policy. If your child changes schools, a new form must be filled out and
submitted to your child’s new school. 
 I do NOT wish to have my child photographed or videotaped for news media or school publicity
purposes.
