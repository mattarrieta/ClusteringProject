Random digit dialing
 Random digit dialing (RDD) is a method for selecting people for involvement in telephone statistical
surveys by generating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_number"] telephone numbers at random. Random digit dialing has the advantage that it
includes unlisted numbers that would be missed if the numbers were selected from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_book"] phone book. In
populations where there is a high telephone-ownership rate, it can be a cost efficient way to get complete
coverage of a geographic area.
RDD is widely used for statistical surveys, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election"] election [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling"] opinion polling[1] and selection of
 experimental control groups.[2]
When the desired coverage area matches up closely enough with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code"] country codes and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code"] area codes, random
digits can be chosen within the desired area codes. In cases where the desired region doesn't match area
codes (for instance, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district"] electoral districts), surveys must rely on telephone databases, and must rely on self-
reported address information for unlisted numbers. Increasing use of mobile phones (although there are
 currently techniques which allow infusion of wireless phones into the RDD sampling frame), number
portability, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP"] VoIP have begun to decrease the ability for RDD to target specific areas within a country
and achieve complete coverage.
