This is overtime salary which the Department is contractually required to pay whenever an officer or supervisor works outside of his or her scheduled work shift. This is mostly
used for covering vacancies in the patrol division. This level service request includes the 5+% increase due to new patrolman contact being ratified. Being a young department
adds to overtime as there is a lot of training necessary. Some of the increase was taken from the Court Overtime line. The new patrol contract increases the OT rate
significantly with the inclusion of education.

The Police Department has 21 marked cruisers which are used for patrol functions. These cruisers are subjected to much more intensive wear and tear as compared to regular
vehicles. They contain power-intensive equipment and may operate for extended periods of time, both idling and operating with high demands on the engines, brakes, electrical
systems, and powertrains. These vehicles operate on a 24/7 basis. 
Our goal is to implement a 3 year rotation, whereby marked patrol cruisers are recycled for less critical and demanding use within the Department after 3 years, so as to extend
their lifecycles. This is cost-effective because the major components are prone to failure after 3 years of front-line patrol use. From a financial standpoint, it makes sense to
recycle these vehicles rather than to risk having to perform major repairs, which is expensive and which takes the vehicle out of service.

Communicator. All fire service credentialing requires continuing education provided at accredited in-state conferences. Timing of these conferences is late Spring and early Fall. 
All Spring FY20 conferences have been postponed to Fall FY21 (not cancelled). No Fall FY21 conferences have been cancelled. In effect, all Spring conferences will be
doubled-up in FY21 because of the Covid-19 Pandemic (original Spring FY20 conferences + Spring FY21 conferences in FY21).  The requirement to attend double Spring
conferences in FY21 is due to the fact that the various credentialing Boards have not indicated that they will waive any of the continuing education hours for FY20. What has
been reduced out of the budget request is hotel rooms for in-state conferences - in the past used for valuable professional development networking. This will slightly impact our
demand on mileage reimbursements for travel back and forth for multiple-day conferences. The 57120 Object account also funds mandatory course books for registration-free
required classes at the Massachusetts Fire Academy.

(Car 2): The Shift Commander vehicle, Car 2, is utilized by the on-duty Deputy Chief 24/7 and is stationed at Fire Station #5 at 520 Concord Street. The amount and type of use
for this vehicle is similar to a police patrol car in that has around-the-clock use and significant idle time. For this reason, it should be replaced on a 5-year replacement cycle, 
and is being requested in the Operating Budget as a Small Capital Vehicle expense. The current Car 2 is a 2015 Ford Expedition. This vehicle needs to be able to respond in
any weather conditions, hold a significant amount of firefighting equipment, and contain an Incident Command Post in the rear compartment. The deferred amount for a
like-kind replacement is $53,600.

Salary & Wages - Regular  -  -  209,000  160,978  -  48,022 77.02% 195,874
Regular Full Time salaries are for the staff that work at Edgell Grove Cemetery & include the following: 1 Construction Supervisor (1116 Union Memebr), 1 Working Supervisor
(1156 Union Member), 1 MEO I Laborer (1156 Union Member), & 1 Administrative Assistant 3 (Non-Bargaining).  All applicable step increases are included. We are using the
latest W Schedule effective 7/1/18 for the 2 Edgell Grove 1156 Union employees and the latest PK Schedule effective 7/1/18 for the 1 Edgell Grove 1116 Union employees as
well as the Non bargaining M Salary Schedule effective 7/1/19, for this budget preparation.

Straight overtime is used for the Admin Assistant III (Melissa Leporati) who normally only works 30 hours per week. She attends Trustee meetings once a month for a couple of
hours and is entitled to straight overtime pay.
Overtime - Time & 1/2  -  -  -  10,337  -  -10,337 100.00%  24,500
We anticipate roughly $24,500 in OT expense’s from the 2 laborer’s and Superintendent of Edgell Grove and $500 in expenses from the Administrative Assistant III in support of
yearly operations during FY21. In using actuals from FY19 ($27,711) and combining actuals and projected expenses for FY20 ($17,000 transferred or requested transfer into
account, with anticipation of another $6,000-$7,000) we feel that a request of $25,000 will adequately fund this account for FY21. These services include support of ongoing
maintenance, snow removal operations, landscaping operations, burial service preparation and support, and any other unforeseen circumstance that requires additional OT
coverage. In addition, staff salaries are due to increase as a result of normal step increases through bargaining agreements (1116 & 1156) that will further drive up the cost of
overtime. While we have been able to reduce expenses through creative scheduling and supporting Cemetery operations through our Parks Maintenance Department, we
continue to anticipate the need for this service.

Cemetery Contract = $22,638
The cemetery maintenance contract needs to go out to bid in FY21. Leone's Landscaping Company currently has the contract for $20,580 We are going to factor in a 10% 
increase in case the bid comes in higher in FY21. ($20,580 + $2,058 = $22,638).
Tree Removal = $50,000
The Cemeteries Department consists of 4 cemeteries and each of these locations requires ongoing maintenance including pruning of healthy trees and removal of risk trees. 
Neglecting tree maintenance increases liability and creates public safety concerns for public property users and abutters.
The Superintendent of Maintenance, who is also a Certified Arborist, walked the entire Edgell Grove tree line with a tree pruning and removal company currently under contract
with the Parks Maintenance Department to identify the current status of wooded areas. This review resulted in the identification of roughly 40 trees of various size that need to be
removed as soon as possible to ensure safety at the Cemetery. Using the current contract in place for Parks Maintenance, the estimated cost for these removals was roughly
$120,000. We are proposing tackling this issue in phases and issuing a contract for tree removals and pruning services for Edgell Grove Cemetery, Old South Cemetery, Main
Street Cemetery, and Edwards Cemetery. This budget request includes roughly $50,000 to begin these removals.
Tree Pruning = $20,000
Tree pruning is an onfoing part of our tree maintenance program and is necessarry to prune low hanging branches that may break off and cause damage to both people and
property. The $20,000 represnts approximately 10 days of tree work as quoted by Arbor Works, our contractor. 
Gravestone Repairs: = 1,000
The four cemeteries old gravestones deteriorate and break via natural causes and vandalism. This line item is needed to repair these gravestones. This work is contracted with
professional monument companies. Storms tend to loosen the monument fittings of many grave sites pushing the gravestones further up and out. If they are not repaired they
will topple over. We are budgeting $1,000 for gravestone repairs for FY21.
Other Miscellaneous repairs = $5,500
We would also like to budget $5,500 for miscellaneous repairs/services that may occur throughout the year at all 4 cemeteries and 6 buildings including mausoleum lettering, 
foundation pours; fence repairs; facility maintenance; painting services; etc..
52420 
Total Maint – Building & Grounds: = $99,138 (the contract amount of $22,638 + 50,000 for tree removal + $20,000 for tree pruning + $1,000 for gravestone repair + $5,500 for
other miscellaneous repairs)

This request is for various consulting services in support of Cemetery operations. The primary expected cost is associated with a full property survey that will provide lot
boundary lines in an effort to reduce encroachment issues from abutters and clearly define in the field what is Edgell Grove Cemetery property. This will also allow the Division to
properly plan long term expansion areas for additional burial lots, further ensuring the financial stability of Edgell Grove Cemetery into the future. In addition, it will allow Division
staff to properly manage and maintain the entirety of Edgell Grove Cemetery property. Through conversations between the Superintendent of Maintenance and staff at DPW, it
was recommended we contract out this service due to the enormity of this project and time constraints of DPW professional staff. As such, the Division received a price estimate
and scope of work for this service that has totaled $36,400. Our request of $50,000 covers this needed expense and additional, anticipated expenses related with normal Edgell
Grove Cemetery operations.

In FY2018 $2008 was spent on landscaping materials to replace shrubs etc that did not survive the dry conditions following a sprinkler system malfunction. Keeping the exterior

transportation request must be pre-approved by the Director or the Supervisor of Social Service/Outreach. On occasion, a request to Leonard Morse Hospital in Natick is
approved to maintain continuity of care. We have asked the Friends of Callahan to assist us if needed to cover any additional costs. The rate ranges from approximately $6 to
$40 depending on the distance. The expense is dependent on how many people need transportation for unexpected issues that would be beyond their means. Maintaining the
amount at $2,200 for FY21 seems appropriate until we see how usage may be affected with the MWRTA van. The Callahan Center also offers volunteer escorted transportation
whenever possible at no cost to the the Town or to the participant.

We have ten printers, seven of which require laser cartridges to be ordered from our vendor Page after Page. The average cost per color cartridge is approximately $220. Our
target population still relies on paper copies to a large extent over online information sources. Adding color increases the visibility and interest. Since the new contract with 
Xerox covers the cost of toner replacements for the main copier/printer for the Center, this amount should meet our needs.

We are choosing to use this account for the Volunteer Recognition Event and any other meals- related expenses on behalf of volunteers and senior participants. We will utilize
the state formula grant for the events previously paid from this account: Veterans' luncheon and Jewels of Framingham. This change makes for a more streamlined process of
POs and payables. We anticipate more volunteers in FY21, with a dedicated Volunteer Coordinator on staff.
Dues & Subcriptions  530  297  545  549  -  -4  100.79%  545

membership dues in other senior related organizations, previously paid from this line item.

MA Senior Action Council = $50.
Total = $540 based on currently available information. We are again requesting $545 to cover possible increases in subscription rate or dues.

In FY21, we are requesting an increase of $1,855 in the Training & Conference line for airfare and hotel stays at conferences for the Director & Assistant Director. It will aid in
the Assistant Director's professional development to attend a national conference. (In Fy19 this expense was charged to line 57140.) This expense will likely occur on alternate
years. We are also using this account for trainings attended by Social Service staff. Other staff trainings will be covered by the formula grant. It is necessary to keep the staff
trained in certain areas. Particular attention is in the health care delivery systems. Our seniors are very reliant on our counseling initiatives in this area. The state provides most
training, which keeps costs down. Staff also frequently seek out no cost trainings for required CEUs. The breakout is listed below. 
MCOA hotel stay $450 2 days X 2 staff = $900 for Director & Asst Director

Mileage Reimbursements 409  574  500  392  -  108 78.34%  200
This account is used to cover the mileage for two staff in the Social Service Department in order to perform their home and hospital visits and allow other staff to attend seminars
and professional meetings. As the population ages, it is likely the staff will need to make more home visits. We expect more outreach efforts by the Bilingual Outreach worker in
the community. The current Admin. Asst. III declines the mileage reimbursement for using her car on City business, payroll, mail etc. on a weekly basis. We are again
requesting $500.
Travel  202  2,303  300  296  -  4  98.73%  50
This is used to cover occasional tolls or parking fees to attend meetings or trainings or such expenses as commuter rail or Logan Express. We are reducing this to reflect pattern
when this was not used for travel to and from conference; that usage is now incorporated into the Conference expense account 57120.
Computers - Personal Computers -  -  450  -  -  450  - %  450
We are requesting an increase of $765 for a PC for the Customer Service Rep position. In FY15 we spent $2,030 to replace the touch screen data collection system, maintained
by Xavus Solutions with an all in one touchscreen system. We budgeted for a replacement of one of the units in FY19, since its life expectancy was 5 years. The cost has
decreased to $1,450. We expect to cover $1,000 of this expense with state grant funds. We will keep $450 in for FY21 in case the system does not need to be replaced in FY20.

Shift Differential is for full time 1156 Union member Park Maintenance employees who work second shift for approximately 23 weeks per fiscal year..  The employee is allowed
a 9% increase in their hourly rate per the 1156 Union contract. This is calculated by increasing a Working Foreman's regular pay at a W11/1 by 9% and then taking the
difference between the regular rate and the 9% increase rate and multiplying by the number of weeks and hours needed. 
W11/ 1 = $22.33 x 9% = $24.34 Difference is $2.01 x 40 hrs x 17 weeks = $1,367

Building & Grounds Services: $65,000
We have millions of dollars in properties to keep attractive and functional. The Park and Rec Department has many buildings, facilities and structures that need to be maintained
and improved, including three bathhouses, three buildings at Cushing, Bowditch Field, Danforth Park, Mary Dennison Park, Longs, Galvani, etc This account is used for
specialized trades including electricians, irrigation technicians, pest control, plumbers, locksmiths, specialized welding, masonry, overhead garage door repairs, fence repairs, 
painting services, as well as an elevator maintenance contract and repairs for the elevators at Bowditch Stadium .  Our department does many service repair type work in
house but cannot provide the contracted work described above. Some examples of FY19 expenditures out of this account include: $16,261 to Newport Construction for parking
lot paving at the Maintenance Building, $9,400 to ACME Lighting for the repair of both the Bowditch Football & baseball scoreboards, $3,800 to Henniker Directional Drilling for
drilling services at Longs Field storm drainage, $4,899 to All about Air for air conditioning compressor replacement services at the Bowditch Office, $2,296 for electrical services, 
$2,100 for Hydrosedding services at Longs Field, $2,854 for Elevator Services at Bowditch Stadium. 
(11.98%)
In FY19 we transferred over $14,000 out of this account to cover help cover funding needs in support of the Loring Arena Project (Clerk of the Works contract) as well as well as
unexpected vehicle repairs .  Because of this we had to defer tree work at Pamela Road. Our FY20 request included funding for this service, but the funding request was not
fully granted. The FY21 request includes needed work at Pamela Rd that has been deferred since FY19 in an effort to address life-safety issues at this facility. This will be a
multi-year project, as outlined in the Benjamin Forestry report. 
Also, a new service in this account for FY21 is NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System).  It is estimated that it will coast $28.50 per catch basin for stormwater
runoff removal, transportation and disposal services. 200 catch basins x $28.50 = $5,700.
Tree Removal: $58,000 
The Parks Maintenance Department manages several hundred acres of properties within the city ranging from heavily wooded passive areas to formal athletic fields. These
parcels include wooded property lines with both residential and business abutters in close proximity. The associated tree infrastructure at each of these locations requires
ongoing maintenance including pruning of healthy trees and removal of risk trees. Examples of heavily wooded park properties include Cushing Memorial Park, Veterans

Memorial Park, Danforth Park, Longs Athletic Complex, Farm Pond, Pamela Rd, etc. When incidents do arise and the claims are being processed, insurance companies inquire
about tree maintenance protocols. Neglecting tree maintenance increases liability and creates public safety concerns for public property users and abutters. 
We are using the surveys from Benjamin Forestry, a professional tree consulting company to assess and identify needed tree removal of old and trees at risk on park properties. 
Benjamin Forestry conducted 4 studies of various Parks properties that identified tree removals and preventative maintenance of the trees most at-risk. This was necessary to
maintain safe and usable amenities. The Parks Department has completed work identified within 3 of those studies. The FY21 budget request is for a portion of work identified
within the final study, which focuses on a large land-locked, heavily abutted property located along Pamela Road. We will continue to address the recommendation within this
final study in future fiscal years as well. This funding request provides tree removal services for both preventative and reactive maintenance. This will have an impact on what
can be completed with the 4th study during FY21. To reduce the financial impact on our operating budget, we are moving forward with the Pamela Rd project as a phased
approach to reduce yearly budget increases.

Sealcoating and Striping
Sealcoating (color coating) and crack filling of the tennis and basketball courts helps protect the surfaces and keeps them playable for our residents over longer periods of time. 
We assess existing conditions at our facilities in the fall as we prepare our operating budgets for the next fiscal year. Depending on existing conditions at our inventory of
facilities in the spring of the budgeted fiscal year (approximately 16 months from now) we may be required to reallocate funds to alternate locations and/or transfer in additional
funds due to the expansion and contraction of surface cracks throughout the change of seasons. Areas include 1 Arlington St. basketball court, 2 Mary Dennison basketball
courts, 4 Bowditch Tennis Courts, 4 Butterworth Tennis Courts, 1 Winch Basketball court, 6 Winch Tennis Courts, 1 Long's Basketball Court, 1 Butterworth Basketball Court and
2 Bowditch Basketball Courts, and a host of half-court basketball courts located at multiple Park facilities throughout the City. This should be part of an ongoing maintenance
program with a few areas being done every year. Sealcoating lasts about 5 to 6 years depending on usage and surface reaction to New England weather. After each winter we
reassess the damages and areas that need attention. At some point the court surfaces need to be reclaimed and reconstructed, similar to parking lots and roadways. These
projects are currently carried in our long-term capital plan. Currently, Arlington Street (full sized basketball court), Anna Murphy (1/2 basketball court, 2 tennis courts), and
Roosevelt Park (1/2 basketball court) are all in need of repairs and sealcoating. These courts have not received sealcoating or crack repairs within the recommended timeframe
and require the proposed maintenance. The Parks Department received a written quote from New England Sealcoating for both color sealcoating and crack repair services at
these locations, totaling $44,898. The quote was received in January of 2020 and is anticipated to increase due to continued damage and the inability to undertake this project
until FY21. As a result, this request takes into consideration appropriate contingencies that will cover potential cost increases. These contingencies total 10% and are included in
the overall Recreational Surfacing Maintenance line item request.

seeder/slicers, scoreboards, parts cleaner service,etc. This account is very volatile & can easily be under budgeted with some unexpected large bills that can occur with our
heavy equipment or can easily be over budgeted if the numerous pieces of equipment we own perform well in a given fiscal year. The Park Department Maintenance Mechanic
along with the Superintendent of Park Maintenance & Construction Supervisors determine when to send our departments heavy equipment to outside vendors for specialty
repairs that we do not perform. We spent over $12,000 in this account in FY15 due in large part to repair bills for our John Deere Tractor, Case Loader, Gang Mowers and
Bobcat. Our equipment performed well in FY16, FY17, & FY18 with only $2,083, $415, and $4,327 spent on equipment repair in those respective fiscal years. However, in
FY19 we spent $10,927, $6,686 of which was for repairs to a Kubota Tractor and $2,034 for repairs to a gang mower. So far in FY20 we have already spent $8,071.

Portable Toilets:
We currently provide portable toilets at some of our higher use locations including, Bowditch, Cushing, Farm Pond, and Mary Dennison & Butterworth Parks. We have many
requests for other locations from user groups. At these locations, we pass the cost of the units on to the groups requesting them. Based on public feedback concerning the
cleanliness of the portable toilets, we've determined that twice a week cleaning is required during the height of the season from May - November. United Site Services, our
portable toilet vendor, has informed us that Handicap units will increase by $15 and regular units will increase by $10 in FY21. The breakout for the portable toilets is listed

Throughout the year we are faced with situations that require hiring professional analysis and consultation services such as lighting consultants, landscape architects, 
environmental engineers, structural engineers, soils analysis, etc. These services are critical to assessing and addressing short-term infrastructure needs that impact our
day-to-day operations, as well as securing engineering plans and estimates associated with proper long-term capital planning. In addition, we apply for grants that require
concept plans and engineering estimates in advance of any funds being awarded. We have successfully positioned the City to receive millions of dollars in alternative resources
as a result of effectively utilizing these services, including PARC grants, Rotary Donations, CDBG funds, Disabilities Commission funds, etc. Our capital budgeting and planning
efforts are greatly improved through the use of this line item. 
We had budgeted $60,000 in past years for these services but this line item was reduced to $23,399 (from $60,000) as part of the FY19 budget reductions. As a result, the
Division has deferred multiple projects including a study and design for the City’s first dog park, City-wide field usage master plan, and a number of additional projects that have
been presented by various stakeholders. In addition, during the last two fiscal years, we have had the need to utilize this account to fund the Clerk of the Works for the Loring
Arena project due to funding constraints in the allocated Capital Appropriation. Our FY21 request to increase funding to $50,000 would aim to replenish this line item in an effort
to undertake deferred services and attempt to meet the growing need for additional professional analysis and consultation services in support of the Division’s capital and
operating budgets as well as long-range plans. The projects that have been deferred for these reasons are redesign of Arlington Street Park; redesign of Danforth Park; 
redesign of Reardon Park; various parking lot replacement design efforts; City-wide field usage master plan; Winch Tennis and Basketball Court replacement design and
specification packet; Bowditch Tennis and Basketball replacement design and specification packet; Maintenance & Operations Facility expansion; dog park feasibility and

Police details are needed for anticipated busy weekends at the beaches and multiple special events such as football games, movie night, etc..Appropriate police presence
provides crowd control, ensures public safety, and provides appropriate site security. The Police Department quoted us the following regular hourly rate for rank (Superior) 
officers: $56.97. This rate needs to be adjusted as follows depending on the day of the week services are required:
Monday - Saturday = $56.97 per hour
Sundays are contractually billed at 1.5 times the base rate= $85.45 ($56.97 / hr x 1.5)

These funds are used to replenish our stock of cleaning supplies as required throughout the year for services associated with our buildings infrastructure. This includes
Bowditch facilities, beach bathhouses, Cushing Buildings, bathrooms & locker rooms, etc. Cleaning supplies include paper towels, liquid soap, bathroom tissue, surface
cleaners, ice melt, doggy bags etc. that we purchase from our vendor Clean & Safe. We are again requesting $11,000.

Supplies & Materials - $160,000
This account is used for purchasing various types of supply materials such as fertilizer, grass seed, insecticides, fungicides, ballfield clay, loam, playground safety chips/bark
mulch, flowers & plants, irrigation supplies and other miscellaneous items such as ballasts & light bulbs for ball fields, lumber, plumbing supplies, locks & keys, sod, hardware, 
fencing materials, welding stock, gravel, limestone, ice melt, stone dust, gates, nuts and bolts, 55 gallon trash barrels, playground equipment parts, etc. 
$70,550 was spent out of this account in FY19 for Fertilizer & grass seed, which are the biggest expenditures from this account annually. Fertilizer and seeding is applied to all
irrigated athletic facilities/complexes. Specifically, fertilizer is applied to 26 unique locations, totaling approximately 100 acres, on a seasonal basis. In addition, there are
non-athletic, highly visible, irrigated areas within facilities/complexes/other locations (islands, landscape areas, building fronts, etc) that receive routine seasonal fertilization and
seeding. The application of fertilizers to all of these areas promotes turf health to these highly used areas. Industry standards recommends these applications occur on a routine
basis to promote turf health which ensures safe, quality turf for extended high rates of usage. Grass seed is applied to these same areas on a seasonal basis. However, 
additional non-irrigated locations are seeded on an as needed basis usually during the fall growing season. The acreage of these additional locations range from 20-50 acres
depending on the need. Seeding also occurs to play area goal mouths/crease areas (front of soccer/lacrosse/field hockey goal boxes) and middle of football fields to restore
heavily worn turf areas. This seeding occurs annually during early April for fall damage; first week in June for spring damage; and any additional areas that were worn during the
summer sports/programming season is seeded in the first and second week of September. 
In FY19, we transferred out $7,300 for the purchase of a Polaris ATV that was part of a grant from MassTrails. Our funding request for FY20 and FY21 is reflective of what is
needed to support operations. 
Ballfield clay and loam are installed on skinned areas (infields) of baseball and softball diamonds. This is replaced on a yearly basis and as needed throughout the season. 
Loam is an additive that is placed on grass areas of fields that help turf surfaces grow. Loam is also placed on landscaped areas to help with plant growth and overall City
beautification. 
Playground safety chips are installed seasonally and as needed under all playground equipment to act as a safety element. According to the National Safety Council, playground
areas should maintain a minimum of 12" of safety fiber (chips) to ensure safe play. With 20 playgrounds located throughout the City on Parks Property, constant monitoring and
safety chip installation is conducted. Bark mulch is installed as an accent to landscaped areas throughout the City. The Parks Department maintains 70 unique sites that include
plantings and landscape features. Bark mulch is installed seasonally and as needed throughout the year.
Flowers & Plants are purchased annually purchase and are planted in over 70 locations Citywide including such locations as Buckminster Square, Cushing Memorial Park, 
Veteran's Memorial Park, Costanza Park , local business-sponsored Island beds, Vernon Street island bed, Village Hall Commons, etc. Flowers and plants are replaced
seasonally or as needed. These locations are also either irrigated or included on the overall watering schedule. These landscape areas give a welcoming approach to motorist
traveling throughout our community (Buckminster Square entrance to Downtown) as well as those who visit Municipal Buildings and offices (Bowditch, Loring Arena, Callahan
Center, Atheneum Hall, Academy Building, Cushing Memorial Park, Cushing Chapel, etc).
Miscellaneous Equipment - $10,000 (Miscellaneous Equipment was moved from the small capital account to the Supplies - Materials account by the CFO's Office in FY16)
We have a wide range of miscellaneous power equipment that is used heavily in our day-to-day operations. As required, we replace, back pack leaf blowers, hedge trimmers, 
leaf vacs, chain saws, generators, and power attachments as needed. We will buy replacement engines to extend life of small tractors, rider mowers, rollers, etc. that also get

Enclosed 8.5 x 14 Landscape Trailer - $9,469
Quote is from Richey & Clapper
This piece of equipment would be used to transport equipment in an enclosed and secure manner. Our current enclosed trailer is falling apart and has been fixed many times to
secure the outer covering as it has become worn over time with many miles on it. The side door has become worn and has popped open due to the shifting of the trailer frame. 
Leaving the equipment in a self-contained closed unit would utilize the 4 man crew more effectively. We would surplus the current trailer in an effort to return some funds to the
City general budget upon replacement.

CAM Superline 19 Foot Flat Deck Trailer - $8,244
Quote is from Richey & Clapper
We need a new open trailer to move equipment for operational purposes. Our older trailer has been incurring expensive repairs; the frame is bent and are showing signs of
wear and tear. The deck is rotting and needs to be replaced the axel will need to be rebuilt. The bent frame is a major concern.
This trailer replaces an existing 1998 open deck trailer with raised metal sides and wheel wells that obstructs our ability to load and transport larger pieces of equipment, 
including gang mowers. This new trailer has no raised edges or wheel wells and will allow for loading and transport of our largest pieces of equipment, with the exception of our
Case and John Deere loaders. We would surplus the current trailer in an effort to return some funds to the City general budget upon replacement.

Also, as per the new 1116 Union Contract 3 1116 employees, (Weston,Coughlin and Hinton) will get paid for holidays worked during the Loring Arena operating season. 
.Those days are: Columbus Day, Veterans Day , Day before Christmas, New Years Day, Martin Luther King Day, and Presidents Day (Hours worked on Labor Day ,
Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day only for Arena Director). The calculation is as follows:
Hinton- $29.06 per hour x 48 hours = $1,395
Coughlin- $29.06 per hour x 48 hours = $1,395
Weston -$48.42 per hour x 60 hours = $2,905

Purchases of books, audio visual, digital materials to meet the informational, recreational, educational needs of the community. The Massachusetts Board of Library
Commissioners requires the Library to allocate 12% of the total budget for library materials. In most communities, this total is derived solely from municipal appropriation. In
Framingham, the requirement has been historically attained from a combination of sources. Municipal appropriation, grant writing, restricted Trust Funds, and generous support
from the Friends of the Framingham Library, Inc. 
The support from the Friends was once a significant percentage of the equation. Revenue derived from the Friends’ video rental program once exceeded over $130K. With
changes in the way the public views movies, this revenue source has diminished significantly in recent years. A projected revenue of 15K in FY2021 is, perhaps an overly
optimistic projection. In any case, this reduced amount makes the program unsupportable for two primary reasons: One, the staff time allocated to the collection, organizing, 
reporting and depositing of rental fees no longer “equates” with the revenue. Secondly, and most importantly, charging patrons for video rental fees isn’t great public service
because there is no longer a cost saving comparison for our patrons. Find a Blockbuster Store. In other words, the end has arrived for what once was a great service to
Framingham residents. 
The initial collection of library materials housed on the Library’s new Bookmobile was purchased from the $150,000 that the Framingham Public Library Foundation raised to
return this terrific service model to Framingham. We are now looking to sustain that collection by respectfully requesting an additional $5,000.00 be added to the Library
Materials line for this purpose.

Currently, the Framingham Public Library offers six public spaces in which programs are held, people attend classes, and individuals and organizations meet. No matter the
event, audio visual equipment is almost always requested. While the A/V capabilities in the Library’s two large community rooms are up-to-date, the Library’s smaller meeting
rooms are without exception, either out of date, broken, or simply without audio visual capability at all. The last A/V installation in these rooms or upgrade was over a decade
ago. The proposal seeks to address this with installation of presentation equipment that is affordable, maintainable, and easy to operate by all users.
