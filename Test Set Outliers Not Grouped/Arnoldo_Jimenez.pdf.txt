Background
Arnoldo Jimenez and Estrella Carrera were married on May 11,
2012, at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_City_Hall"] Chicago City Hall. Carrera had two children, one 9-year-
old daughter from a previous relationship, and a 2-year-old son
with Jimenez.[3] The couple had dinner with family and friends
that night and then headed to a night club, which they left around 4
a.m. on the morning of May 12.[4]
Murder
It is believed by the FBI that on the way home the couple got into
a heated argument in Jimenez's black 2006 four-door Maserati.
Jimenez then fatally stabbed Carrera multiple times in his car and
dragged her body into her apartment.[2] Carrera's body was
dumped in the bathtub at her apartment,[2] and she was still
wearing the same silver dress she wore to her wedding.[5]
Carrera was meant to pick up her children from family members
on May 12, but she never showed up. Her family members then
reported her missing to police. Her body was found inside her

apartment on the afternoon of May 13.[2] Police confirmed there was no sign of a forced entry. Jimenez had
also disappeared and his car was nowhere to be found.[6]
Three days later on May 15, Jimenez was charged with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_degree_murder"] first degree murder and a state warrant was issued
for his arrest. A federal warrant followed after he was charged with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_flight_to_avoid_prosecution"] unlawful flight to avoid prosecution on
May 17.[1]
Investigation
Investigators began tracking Jimenez and found that on May 12 he had used his cellphone in Chicago, then
 Southern Illinois. It was later used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee"] Memphis, Tennessee, and then in Arkansas. On May 13 he had made
calls from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston"] Houston and then in Hidalgo, Mexico.[7]
In September 2012, police made a drug arrest on Jimenez's brother, Humberto. During the search of his
property, police discovered Arnoldo's black Maserati in the garage. Blood was found inside the car, leading
police to the conclusion that Jimenez had killed Carrera in his car and dragged her body into the bathtub
inside her apartment.[8] Police believe Humberto drove Arnoldo to Mexico in his car and left him there.[9]
 The FBI believes Jimenez is still hiding in Durango, Mexico, specifically in the area of Santiago
Papasquiaro.[1][10] He may also be hiding in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico.[1][11]
