After the payment of the Liquidation Preference to the holders
of the Series A Preferred, the remaining assets shall be
distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock and the
Series A Preferred on a common equivalent basis. 
A merger, acquisition or sale of substantially all of the assets of
the Company in which the shareholders of the Company do not
own a majority of the outstanding shares of the surviving
corporation shall be deemed to be a liquidation.
Conversion: The holders of the Series A Preferred shall have the right to
convert the Series A Preferred, at any time, into shares of
Common Stock. The initial conversion rate shall be 1:1, subject
to adjustment as provided below.
Automatic Conversion: The Series A Preferred shall be automatically converted into
Common Stock, at the then applicable conversion price, (i) in
the event that the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding Series A Preferred consent to such conversion or (ii)
upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering of
shares of Common Stock of the Company at a per share price
not less than three times the Original Purchase Price (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and the like) per share
or for a total offering of not less than $25 million (before
deduction of underwriters commissions and expenses) (a
“Qualified IPO”).
Antidilution Provisions: The conversion price of the Series A Preferred will be subject to
a full ratchet adjustment to reduce dilution in the event that the
Company issues additional equity securities (other than shares
reserved as employee shares described under “Employee Pool”
below or securities issued pursuant to partnering arrangements,
capital leases or other standard exceptions) at a purchase price
less than the applicable conversion price. The conversion price
will also be subject to proportional adjustment for stock splits,
stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like.
Redemption at Option
of Investors: At the election of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Series A
Preferred, the Company shall redeem the outstanding Series A
Preferred in three annual installments beginning on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing. Such redemptions shall be at a
purchase price equal to the Original Purchase Price plus
declared and unpaid dividends.
Voting Rights: The Series A Preferred will vote together with the Common
Stock and not as a separate class except as specifically
provided herein or as otherwise required by law. Each share of
Series A Preferred shall have a number of votes equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon
conversion of such share of Series A Preferred.
Board of Directors: The maximum size of the Company’s Board of Directors shall be
set at five. The Board shall initially be composed of three
members appointed by the holders of the Series A Preferred,
one member to be appointed by the Common Stock holders,
and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
