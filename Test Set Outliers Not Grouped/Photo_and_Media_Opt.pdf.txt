Photo and Media Opt-Out Form 
The Holgate Local Schools are making a concerted effort to promote the positive activities, 
honors and work of our students and staff members. This includes working cohesively with local
newspapers, radio and television stations. Additionally, the district produces print media and
digital projects periodically utilizing the district’s website. These publications may include
information, likenesses, names and images of students. 
Throughout the year there are many opportunities for Holgate Local Schools’ students to be
photographed, interviewed and identified by name, classroom or school. Some parents/guardians
may request that we do not list the name(s) of their child(ren) with photos. Please complete the
form below to inform us of your wishes regarding publicity. 
Please Note: Your child’s image or likeness MAY appear in candid photos without any type of
name identification, and the use of these candid photos is permissible. Additionally, this photo
release form does not apply to photographs taken during extra-curricular activities by
newspapers. The district cannot control that situation. 
If you wish to EXCLUDE your child’s photograph or image from district-controlled use, please
indicate below and mail or bring this form to your child’s school by September 5, 2014. You
may list all children in your family on one form. 
You have granted the district permission to publish your child’s photo unless this form is
returned. You do not need to return this form unless you wish to exclude your child’s photo. 
Please call your child’s principal if you have any questions.
