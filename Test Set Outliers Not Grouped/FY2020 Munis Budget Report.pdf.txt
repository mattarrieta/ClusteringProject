department managed the shortfall by not treating Waushakum or Farm Ponds while awaitng results of a botanical survey. Last year we treated
Waushakum for the first time in four years. The costs associated with treating the Sudbury River were partially offset by a grant, which is not
available this coming season. The funding increase will ensure program activity at Waushakum and Farm Pond, as well as provide for

The Permitting Department often requires professional review of its documents or preparation of documents. These funds are intended as a

be made. Funds requested are in the amount of $2,000.00.

In FY18, the Planning Board purchased an IPad for the Associate Planner for the purposes of field inspections of Planning Board projects. The
Associate Planner position spends approximately 50 percent of his time in the field reviewing development projects. Pursuant to the merge of
the Planning Board and the ZBA Departments, the Associate Planner will conduct conformance review for projects approved by both the
Planning Board and the ZBA. 
The Planning Board’s use of the IPad and ACCELA has dramatically enhanced and increased staff efficiency. ACCELA is a web based permit
tracking and reporting software tool, which can be easily accessed while working in the field. Therefore, a data package is necessary for the
IPad to allow the Associate Planner to review and report site plans, provide mark-ups in the field, and provide a review report of the site visit
while in the field. Such data package is $39.99 per month. Since the Associate Planner only requires internet access in the field, the Permitting
Department proposes to reallocate $220 of the Planning Board’s appropriated FY19 Telephone – Cellular line be reallocated to the Postage
line, while still making a portion of these funds available in FY20 for Telephone - Cellular (total requested amount of $500).
Budget History/Reallocation of Funds Previously Approved in FY19 – No increase in funding requested for FY20, below are the approved FY19
budget numbers

The Police Department has 21 marked cruisers which are used for patrol functions. These cruisers are subjected to much more intensive wear
and tear as compared to regular vehicles. They contain power-intensive equipment and may operate for extended periods of time, both idling
and operating with high demands on the engines, brakes, electrical systems, and powertrains. These vehicles operate on a 24/7 basis. 
Our goal is to implement a 3 year rotation, whereby marked patrol cruisers are recycled for less critical and demanding use within the
Department after 3 years, so as to extend their lifecycles. This cost-effective because the major components are prone to failure after 3 years of
front-line patrol use. From a financial standpoint, it makes sense to recycle these vehicles rather than to risk having to perform major repairs, 
which is expensive and which takes the vehicle out of service.
Equipment  57,079  67,304  92,946  13,000  11,600

of reasons for the magnitude of this disparity. Primarily, overtime pay rates have increased steadily over the last 4 years, following collective
bargaining increases in base pay, and with no matching increase in overtime funding during that time period. Additionally, the funded budget
for FY19 overtime costs was actually a budget reduction from the prior year, even though a transfer from the Police Department budget was
needed to balance the overtime accounts at the end of the FY18. The Fire Department is requesting that the overtime budget line items be
increased by 28% ($333,039) for FY20 from the original FY19 budget

In accordance with Section 100 in Chapter 41 of the Massachusetts General Laws, and the 02/08/2008 Settlement with the Framingham Fire
Fighters Local 1652, the City is statutorily obligated to cover the costs of any medical bills for firefighters that are injured while working in
performance of their duties. For FY19, the Fire Department was originally budgeted $115,000 for such purposes. This was consistent with the
last two fiscal years’ actual spending and included a 15% reserve. It is very difficult to accurately predict medical expenses from year to year, 
as these payments are resulting from the number and nature of on-the-job accidents (FY16 to FY17 invoices saw a 310% increase, when the
year before was a 70% decrease). The Department is requesting an increase of $35,000 for FY20 to account for these rising costs.

This line item is normally used to fund the continual replacement of firefighting tools that extend beyond their useful life.
The Fire Department is requesting an increase of $14,178 to the Small Capital budget for FY20 as compared to FY19, in order to purchase a
new on-duty shift supervisor SUV (Car 2). This vehicle needs to be on a 5-year replacement cycle due to its high-use and high-idle time, similar
to police cruisers. The vehicle is used 24/7 by the on-duty shift supervisor. It responds to all incidents that require multiple fire department
resources, and serves as an Incident Command Post. Because of this vehicle’s use, it should be on a 5-year replacement cycle and therefore
should not be funded as a 10+ year Capital project, where the City’s debt payments are lasting longer than the life of the vehicle.

Cemetery Contract = $21,560
The cemetery maintenance contract needs to go out to bid in FY20. Leone's Landscaping Company currently has the contract for $19,600. 
We are going to factor in a 10% increase in case the bid comes in higher in FY20. ($19,600 + $1,960 = $21,560) 
209,000 100.00%
Gravestone Repairs: = $1,000
The three cemeteries are very historical. The Old Burying Ground on Main Street and the Old South Cemetery get many visitors from
historically interested people, students, and the general public. The old gravestones deteriorate and break via natural causes and vandalism. 
This line item is needed to repair these gravestones. This work is contracted with professional monument companies. Storms tend to loosen
the monument fittings of many grave sites pushing the gravestones further up and out. If they are not repaired they will topple over. We are
budgeting $1,000 for gravestone repairs in FY20.
Tree Pruning: = $7,944
Arbor Works Tree Company is our tree pruning vendor and they charge us $1,936 per day for tree pruning. We are budgeting for 4 days
days of tree pruning for FY20. $1,986 x 4 days = $7,944.

Assistant III (Tricia Welsby).  Step increases are included in the FY20 budgeted dollar amount for the Non Union "M" salary schedule
employees only. We are using the Non-Union M Salary Schedule effective 7/1/18 for the Assistant Director, Admininistrative Assistant III, and

cancellations or changes to activities, increasing efficient use of staff. We also previously budgeted $936 in this account for the cost of copies
and copier maintenance. The Callahan Center has since joined the other city departments with a Ricoh copier agreement, eliminating the need
for a separate copier agreement. The toner costs will be covered by the cartridges account. The maintenance of the AED Machine and fire
extinguishers is handled by Facilities Management.

We have not been notified by the TS Department of any rate changes. We are keeping this amount at $1,500 given past spending history.
Telephone - Long Distance  22  21  20  23  23
This is for long distance phone calls. Social Services staff often receive calls from adult children, living a distance from their aging parents, who
need assistance. We are again $23 given recent years' trends.
Postage  817  598  671  900  800
We use postage for mailings for our programs such as the AARP Tax Program, Prescription Advantage and Medicare information, the
Winterization Program, programs and services information about the Center, letters to clients and announcements of special programs. We are
again requesting $900. Postage for the Courier newsletter (12 issues a year x $600 monthly = $7,200) is primarily covered by the Friends of
Callahan.
Communications - Advertising  -  3,475  -  3,500  3,500
We plan to insert ads in the MWDN (Metrowest Daily News) about the center's programs and other advertising options. The Friends of Callahan
found this method did generate interest among people unfamiliar with the center. The local papers have been reducing the amount of free
space they allow to senior centers for information. Many seniors still prefer newspapers over the Internet for information. We think this would
generate more usage of the center's programs and services. This amount is available as a result of making reductions in other categories of
expenses.
Communications - Brochures  345  -  204  500  500
This is an ongoing expense for designing, printing, and assembling information about specialized programs of the Center including Outreach, 
Volunteerism and Support Groups. These brochures are distributed at the City Health Fair, the hospital and other health-related agencies, as
well as distributed by the Center to individuals and family members seeking information. Additional brochures may include the property tax
program, home repair program, transportation and volunteerism information etc. The pamphlets need to be updated on a regular basis.
Bus Contract  2,433  1,398  1,822  2,200  2,200
"Dial A Ride" (Tommy's Taxi) is funded by the Callahan Senior Center and is typically limited to Framingham destinations, except in the case of
medical necessity. The transportation request must be pre-approved by the Director or the Supervisor of Social Service/Outreach. On
occasion, a request to Leonard Morse Hospital in Natick is approved to maintain continuity of care. We have asked the Friends of Callahan to
assist us if needed to cover any additional costs. The rate ranges from approximately $6 to $40 depending on the distance. The expense is
dependent on how many people need transportation for unexpected issues that would be beyond their means. Maintaining the amount at
$2,200 for FY20 seems appropriate until we see how usage may be affected with the MWRTA van. The Callahan Center also offers volunteer
escorted transportation whenever possible at no cost to the the Town or to the participant.

Supplies-Laser Cartridges  864  1,858  1,388  1,900  1,500
We have ten printers, seven of which require laser cartridges to be ordered from our vendor Page after Page. The average cost per color
cartridge is approximately $220. Our target population still relies on paper copies to a large extent over online information sources. Adding
color increases the visibility and interest. As of FY19, this account is also used to replenish toner in the Ricoh copier. We are again requesting
$1,900.
Meals - Special Functions  2,559  2,074  2,351  2,700  2,700
This line item is used to cover a portion of the costs associated with multiple programs, including: Volunteer Recognition luncheon, "The Jewels
of Framingham" for residents 90 and older, the Veterans luncheon, and other outreach efforts using food to encourage participation. The
Friends group seeks donations from businesses and vendors who agree to donate food, and items for these and other programs. The
expenses exceeded $2,500 in FY16, as our attendances and volunteer numbers increase. We are again requesting to maintain $2,700 to
account for additional volunteers and more people 90 and older.
Dues & Subcriptions  319  323  530  545  545
These organizations are advocates for seniors on a national and statewide basis. They offer training sessions at a reduced price. This amount
does not include the membership fee of $1,600 to the MA Council on Aging that is paid with the State Formula grant. 
National Council on Aging - $145.
Motion Picture License for Senior Centers - $186 (expected increases in FY20)
MA Senior Action Council - $50. 
MA Gerontological Society - $150.
Total = $531 based on currently available information. We are again requesting $545 to cover possible increases in dues and fees.
Education, Training, Seminars  416  344  1,015  1,995  1,580
It is necessary to keep the staff trained in certain areas. Particular attention is in the health care delivery systems. Our seniors are very reliant
on our counseling initiatives in this area. The state provides most training which keeps cost down. The breakout is listed below. 
MCOA Fall Conference & other conference: $800 (hotel expense for Director & Asst Director)
MCOA Training: 3 people @ $20 = $60 (MCOA provides training for outreach, etc.).

51433 Shift Differential  1,554  1,617  1,391  1,849  1,849
Shift Differential is for full time 1156 Union member Park Maintenance employees who work second shift for approximately 23 weeks per fiscal
year..  The employees are allowed a 9% increase in their hourly rate per the 1156 Union contract. This is calculated by increasing a Working
Foreman's regular pay at a W11/1 by 9% and then taking the difference between the regular rate and the 9% increase rate and multiplying by
the number of weeks and hours needed. 
W11/ 1 = $22.33 x 9% = $24.34 Difference is $2.01 x 40 hrs x 23 weeks = $1,849

Total= $1,849
Seasonal Foreman - Parks  10,420  10,671  10,836  10,733  10,733
We annually upgrade selected individuals to Seasonal Working Foremen to give us the needed supervisory support during the busy season. 
We estimate this number by taking the difference between a MEO I laborer at the top step of a W4 and the first step of a foreman at a W11
level for 26 weeks. We have had between 3 and 4 seasonal working foreman depending on number and quality of staff. We are budgeting for
4, depending on the quality of available supervisory help. 
W11/1 = $22.33
W4 /6 = $19.75

1156 & 1164 Pension Contributn 37,560  43,079  46,108  42,058
The current 1156 LIUNA pension hourly rate is 1.13/hr and the current 1116 hourly rate is 1.86 The calculation is as follows: 
50,400
The following calculation is based on a 40 hour work week for all 1156 members:
12 employees at 2,097 hours = 25,164 hours x 1.13/hr = $28,437 
The following calculation is based on a 40 hour work week for 4 1116 Park Maintenance members:
4 employees at 2,097 hours 8,388 hours x 1.86 = $15,604
Total = $44,041 ($25,671 + $14,176)
WE LOOK TO THE CFO'S OFFICE TO ADJUST THIS NUMBER BASED ON ANY ADDITIONAL RATE CHANGES.

Mary Dennison Park, Longs, Galvani, etc This account is used for specialized trades including electricians, irrigation technicians, pest control, 
plumbers, locksmiths, specialized welding, masonry, overhead garage door repairs, fence repairs, painting services, as well as an elevator
maintenance contract and repairs for the elevators at Bowditch Stadium .  Our department does many service repair type work in house but
cannot provide the contracted work described above. Some examples of FY18 expenditures out of this account include: $9,900 for the erection
of two storage modules at the Maintenance & Operation Facility, $7,789 for new gate installation at Bowditch Field football grandstands, $4,749
for gas furnace replacement at the Maintenance & Operation Facility, $3,840 for bleacher repair at Winch, Bowditch, and Butterworth Parks, 
$3,436 for parking lot paving at Sax Beach, $2,400 for Concrete prep work at Butterworth Park, and $4,990 for electrician services. We are
requesting $65,000 for building and ground services for FY20.
Tree Removal: $38,000
The Parks Maintenance Department manages several hundred acres of properties within the city ranging from heavily wooded passive areas to
formal athletic fields. These parcels include wooded property lines with both residential and business abutters in close proximity. The
associated tree infrastructure at each of these locations requires ongoing maintenance including pruning of healthy trees and removal of risk
trees. Examples of heavily wooded park properties include Cushing Memorial Park, Veterans Memorial Park, Danforth Park, Longs Athletic
Complex, Farm Pond, Pamela Rd, etc. When incidents do arise and the claims are being processed, insurance companies inquire about tree
maintenance protocols. Neglecting tree maintenance increases liability and creates public safety concerns for public property users and
abutters. 
We are using the surveys from Benjamin Forestry, a professional tree consulting company to assess and identify needed tree removal of old

and trees at risk on park properties. Benjamin Forestry conducted 4 studies of various Parks properties that identified tree removals and
preventative maintenance of the trees most at-risk. This was necessary to maintain safe and usable amenities. The Parks Department has
completed work identified within 3 of those studies. The FY20 budget request is for a portion of work identified within the final study, which
focuses on a large land-locked, heavily abutted property located along Pamela Road. We will continue to address the recommendation within
this final study in future fiscal years as well. This funding request provides tree removal services for both preventative and reactive
maintenance. This will have an impact on what can be completed with the 4th study during FY20.
Tree Pruning: $38,000
Arbor works Tree Company is our tree pruning vendor and their daily rate for tree pruning is $1,986 per day. We are budgeting for 19 days.

Sealcoating and Striping
Sealcoating (color coating) and crack filling of the tennis and basketball courts helps protect the surfaces and keeps them playable for our
residents over longer periods of time. We assess existing conditions at our facilities in the fall as we prepare our operating budgets for the next
fiscal year. Depending on existing conditions at our inventory of facilities in the spring of the budgeted fiscal year (approximately 16 months
from now) we may be required to reallocate funds to alternate locations and/or transfer in additional funds due to the expansion and contraction
of surface cracks throughout the change of seasons. Areas include 1 Arlington St. basketball court, 2 Mary Dennison basketball courts, 4
Bowditch Tennis Courts, 4 Butterworth Tennis Courts, 1 Winch Basketball court, 6 Winch Tennis Courts, 1 Long's Basketball Court, 1
Butterworth Basketball Court and 2 Bowditch Basketball Courts, and a host of half-court basketball courts located at multiple Park facilities
throughout the City. This should be part of an ongoing maintenance program with a few areas being done every year. Sealcoating lasts about 5
to 6 years depending on usage and surface reaction to New England weather. After each winter we reassess the damages and areas that
need attention. At some point the court surfaces need to be reclaimed and reconstructed, similar to parking lots and roadways. These projects
are currently carried in our long-term capital plan. Currently, Winch Tennis Courts (6 total courts) are in desperate need of repairs. Over the
past two years, the Winch Tennis Courts have sustained a large amount of damage due to heaving, cracking, and wear & tear associated with
routine usage. The Parks Department received a written quote from East Coast Sealcoating for both color sealcoating and crack repair services
at Winch for $45,000. The quote was received in late October of 2018 and is anticipated to increase due to continued damage and the inability
to undertake this project until FY2020. As a result, this request takes into consideration appropriate contingencies that will cover potential cost
increases. In FY2019, this line item was budgeted for $24,942. For FY2020, we are requesting reallocating funding from our typical
Maintenance Fields (object 52404) request into this line item to help cover the additional expense for FY2020 while reducing the overall
increase to our FY2020 budget request. We will be deferring irrigation projects in FY2020 to cover this much needed service in an effort to
ensure the Winch Tennis Courts are open and in safe condition for the upcoming year.

Throughout the year we are faced with situations that require hiring professional analysis and consultation services such as lighting consultants, 
landscape architects, environmental engineers, structural engineers, soils analysis, etc. These services are critical to assessing and
addressing short-term infrastructure needs that impact our day-to-day operations, as well as securing engineering plans and estimates
associated with proper long-term capital planning. In addition, we apply for grants that require concept plans and engineering estimates in
advance of any funds being awarded. We have successfully positioned the Town to receive millions of dollars in alternative resources as a
result effectively utilizing these services, including PARC grants, Rotary Donations, CDBG funds, Disabilities Commission funds, etc. Our
capital budgeting and planning efforts are greatly improved through the use of this line item. 
We had budgeted $60,000 in past years for these services but this line item got reduced to $23,399 as part of the FY19 budget reductions.

As a result, the Division has deferred multiple projects including a study and design for the City’s first dog park, City-wide field usage master
plan, and a number of additional projects that have been presented by various stakeholders. Our FY20 request to increase funding to $34,000
would aim to replenish this line item in an effort to undertake deferred services and attempt to meet the growing need for additional professional
analysis and consultation services in support of the Division’s capital and operating budgets as well as long-range plans.

Diesel gas prices had remained fairly constant in recent years but we are requesting a $1.00 per gallon increase to $3.00 for FY20. We are
also going to budget for 13,000 gallons which falls in the range of previous years usage. $3.00 x 13,000 gallons = $39,000.

This new piece of equipment would enable us to cover more area with less labor in a more efficient manner. It would be used during spring and

Overtime - Time & 1/2  1,795  4,324  3,836  5,202  4,010
Overtime is budgeted for 2 1116 members (Stan Coughlin - Arena Supervisor and Lawrence Hinton - Arena Supervisor) who are entitled to
overtime by contract. These employees will each work approximately 45 OT hours in a fiscal year. We are budgeting for 90 hours at their 5%

allowed a 5% increase in their hourly rate per the 1116 Union contract. For FY 20 We are requesting to decrease this account to $973. We
have one full time Arena Supervisor (Coughlin) that is a full time night worker with a shift from 3pm to 7pm. The second Arena Supervisor
(Hinton) works days, however he does work some nights during the high school and college hockey season for game coverage. The breakout

Maintenance - Building & Groun  18,392  34,135  28,671  26,580  52,040
This account is for licensed repairmen, boiler, heating, dehumidifiers, plumbing, electrical, ammonia alarms, etc. We do much of our own
preventive maintenance and maintenance repairs. Certain things we hire out because they require licensed technicians or tradesmen such as
boiler repairs, electricians, plumbers, ammonia alarm service, etc. This account is also used for annual inspection of fire extinguishers as well
as $5,500 as a recurring expense for cleaning and maintenance of 6 infrared heating units. We annually alternate the cleaning of each side (3
per side) , home vs. visitors. 
11,271  3.40%
While the boiler was replaced with a brand new energy efficient system that will likely not need an intrusive amount of maintenance, we do still
anticipate requiring a budget in this line item higher than past years due to additional costs, such as the fees for the newly installed elevator
which requires annual maintenance and inspection at approximately $1500 per year. This year we added a large number (15) of fire
extinguishers that will need to be inspected and serviced annually inside the new facility at a cost of approximately $600. Additionally Fire alarm
monitoring is required for monthly monitoring of the alarm system and elevator alarm at a cost of $360 for a total additional cost of $2,460.
This budget request also includes $18,000 for twice a week deep cleaning services from October through March. With the renovation now
complete, the Rink has experienced an increase in both usage and patronage. For instance, between daily usage, including practices and
public skating, combined with the increasing attendance at various games and tournaments, we estimate over 100,000 residents from
Framingham and throughout the State will visit Loring during the 2018-2019 operating season. In addition, the renovated facility now includes
two levels with multiple bathrooms, meetings space, additional locker rooms with showers and bathrooms, storage areas, elevators, community
rooms, etc. that total almost 40,000 square feet. The bleachers and viewing areas for 2,500 spectators are also included in the scope of work. 
During the 2018-2019 operating season, it was an ongoing challenge for staff to continue to keep the facility clean while ensuring everyday

tasks were still completed. Consideration was made to utilize staff on overtime to complete this service, however, this was not cost effective or
feasible with current staffing levels. It is our belief that by contracting out this much needed service during FY2020 and beyond we will continue
to work towards minimizing requests for staffing increases and additional overtime funding.
Maintenance - Equipment  5,259  3,502  2,259  2,500  2,500
This account is used for repair and maintenance for the Zamboni including sharpening services (Accu-Grind) for the Zamboni blades. Fixed

for a fixed cost total of $1,278. We would also like to budget and additional $1,222 for unexpected repairs to our old Zamboni for a total of
$2,500.

lighting equipment above the ice or other needed equipment like repairs to the infrared heat above the stands. This account is used for renting
a lift by Sunbelt rentals at least once sometimes twice per year for multiple projects including cleaning the heating units and lighting fixtures or
changing out the light bulbs in ceilings that are more than 35 feet high. To rent a lift for one week is $1,949 and to rent the same lift for 1 full
month is $2400. It is more cost effective to rent the lift for the entire month rather than just one week out of the year. We originally requested
$2,400 in FY19 but then had to reduce this amount by $700 as part of last years budget reductions.
Prof & Tech - Consultants  4,399  3,350  3,464  3,750  3,750

again requesting $3,750.
Printing Services  413  177  300  300  500
This account is used to print Arena envelopes, tickets for public skating and game admissions, Rental Slips, and flyers. This account fluctuates

the Centrex phone system. The cost in service has change from $1.69 per month to $1.70 per month, I would like to add the $1.00 to offset any
negative balance we may have.
Telephone - Cellular  1,527  1,089  1,638  1,250  1,250
This account is used for a Cell Phone used by the Arena Director.Verizon is our provider. Charges for the one phone with 400 minutes cost
$58/month x 12 months = $696 plus $554 for calls to vendors outside our service and phone upgrade charges = $1,250. No other Arena

Data Line  -  707  603  800  600
In FY 17 we added this object due to the requirement of a data line from Verizon. This data line is needed for a touch screen control panel

Dues & Subcriptions  150  150  150  150  150
This account is used for the rinks annual membership dues for NEISMA (New England Ice Skating Manager's Association) .  This membership
dues is not associated to any one employee in particular but is with the rink as a whole. We are again requesting $150
Education, Training, Seminars  -  516  -  -  500
This account is used for 3 management employees to attend seminars and training in the NEISMA (New England Ice Skating Managers
Association) Conference held bi-annually each spring and fall and for CPR training. This account is to cover cost of seminars and hotel (when
necessary). Spring conference is always attended and fall conference is attended only when local. We originally requested $500 in FY19 but
then had to reduce this amount by $500 as part of last years budget reductions.
Equipment  11,170  23,354  10,076  14,500  26,110
We are requesting $20,100 in FY20 to replace one of the two Thermatec Thermal Plus dehumidifier / ice rink defogger. One of the current
dehumidifiers was replaced in 2018 and the second is over 20 years old and failed upon opening this year resulting in and unexpected $6,000
in repairs that are not guaranteed to last a significant length of time. This also resulted in little to no visibility of the ice through the glass and
constant temperature fluctuation. The refrigerant that is used in the current dehumidifier is being phased out and no longer available for
purchase. Without the dehumidifiers running normally it causes condensation on the ceiling and windows resulting in large brown and black
spot dripping onto the ice surface and glass around the ice surface is not clear for viewing purposes. This cost includes crane service of $5,000
to remove and dispose of the old dehumidifier, install the new one. 
Also being requested is 2 new compressor heads (cylinder blocks) for the Arena compressors that maintain the ammonia system. The current
compressor heads are 56 years old and are in need of being replaced. The cost to replace both compressor heads is $6,000.
