 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION I. GENERAL 
A. Authority
1. The Framingham Zoning Ordinances shall govern land use within Framingham as prepared for and
adopted by the Framingham City Council in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.),
Chapter (c.) 40A. 
2. Hereinafter, these regulations shall be referred to as “Zoning Ordinances” as the collective document, 6
and “Ordinance” for the individual sections, and said document shall be cited as “The City of 7
Framingham Zoning Ordinances.”
B. Purpose
1. The purpose of these Zoning Ordinances is to establish such regulations for the uses of land and
structures. Such Zoning Ordinances shall protect and promote life, health, safety, convenience and
general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of Framingham. The interpretation and application of
the provisions of these Zoning Ordinances shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and overall general welfare. 
2. It shall also be the purpose of these Zoning Ordinances to enhance the public welfare by maintaining an
adequate supply of affordable housing within Framingham. To accomplish this purpose, all applicants for
development or re-development (as defined in Section V.H.2.) of ten or more dwelling units shall be
required to provide or to enable the provision of Affordable Housing Units to home buyers or renters in
accordance with requirements and standards set forth in these Zoning Ordinances and the Affordable
Housing Regulations of the Planning Board. Such development of housing, including those proposed
under a special permit process pursuant to M.G.L. c. 40A §9, and those proposed under the Subdivision
Control Law G. L. c. 41 sec. 81K to 81GG inclusive, including divisions of land that do not require
subdivision approval, shall require a special permit from the Planning Board, as set forth under Section
V.H. Inclusionary Housing. 
Any new Housing Plan/Policy or change to an existing Housing Plan/Policy shall be submitted and
approved by a two-thirds vote of the City Council. 
3. It is not the intent of these Zoning Ordinances repeal, abrogate, annul, or in any way impair or interfere
with any existing provisions of these Zoning Ordinances, or with any rules, laws, regulations, or permits
previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the use of
buildings or premises. However, where these Zoning Ordinances imposes a greater restriction upon the
use of buildings or premises than is imposed or required by such existing provision of law or ordinance or
by such rules or regulations or permits, these Zoning Ordinances shall supersede such existing provisions. 
C. Basic Requirements
Except as hereinafter specified in Section I.D., no building, structure, or land shall be used and no
building or part thereof or other structure shall be erected, raised, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, or
altered, except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located, 
except that nothing in these Zoning Ordinances shall affect the existing use of any building or lot. No lot
may be used for more than one principal use, except as otherwise specifically allowed by these Zoning
Ordinances. 
D. Non-Conforming Buildings, Structure, Uses, and Lots
1. Applicability
The provisions of these Ordinances shall not apply to any building, structure or use lawfully in
existence or lawfully begun, or to a special permit or building permit issued before the first
publication of notice of the public hearing on any amendment hereto, but shall apply to any alteration
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION I. PAGE 3 
Page 7
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION I. GENERAL 
of a building to provide for its use for a purpose, or in a manner, substantially different from the use
to which it was put before the alteration. 
2. Omitted
3. Purpose and Intent
It is the intent of this Ordinance to ensure that nonconforming uses will ultimately comply with the
use requirements of these Zoning Ordinances. 
4. Floor Area Ratio
The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) shall not grant a special permit for an increase in Floor Area
Ratio greater than what is allowed in the district in which it is located. 
5. Change to Nonconforming Single or Two-Family Building or Structure
a. The ZBA shall allow reconstruction, extension or alteration of a lawful, pre-existing
nonconforming residential single or two-family structure where the ZBA finds that the
reconstruction, extension or alteration does not increase the nonconforming nature of the
structure. 
b. The ZBA may authorize, by a finding under G. L. c. 40A, § 6, an alteration, extension, or
structural change to a lawful pre-existing nonconforming residential single or two-family
structure provided such extension or alteration is not substantially more detrimental to the
neighborhood than the existing nonconformity. 
c. Alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change (collectively “alteration”) to a non-
conforming single or two family residential structure, which is considered a non-conforming
structure solely due to its location on a lot with insufficient area, width and/or frontage, shall not
be considered an increase in the non-conforming nature of the structure and shall be permitted by
right if, at the time of application, the structure and alteration will comply with all then current
open space, lot coverage and building height requirements, and the alteration will comply with all
then current setback requirements, as set forth in Section IV.E. of these Zoning Ordinances, and
further provided that such alteration does not result in the conversion of a structure from a single
family use to a two-family use. 
d. The provisions of Section I.D.5.d of the Zoning Ordinances shall not apply to the alteration, 
extension, or structural change (collectively referred to herein as “alterations”) to a single or two-
family residential structure lawfully in existence under the following circumstances: 
1. the proposed alterations do not increase the maximum height of the pre-existing structure; 
and
2. the proposed alterations comply with the requirements for maximum lot coverage, or if
they do not comply, the proposed alterations do not result in an increase in lot coverage; 
and
3. the proposed alterations comply with setback requirements, or, if they do not comply, the
proposed alterations do not result in a decrease in the distance between any lot line and
the nearest point of the structure; and
4. the proposed alterations comply with the requirements for minimum open space, or, if
they do not comply, the proposed alterations do not result in a decrease in the distance
between any lot line and the nearest point of the structure. 
For the purpose of these Zoning Ordinances, an alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural
change meeting the criteria set forth in this subsection d. shall not be deemed to increase the
nonconforming nature of the structure, and is allowable as a matter of right. This provision does
not preclude the ZBA from determining that other alterations, extensions or structural changes to
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION I. PAGE 4 
Page 8
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION I. GENERAL 
a nonconforming single or two-family home do not increase the nonconforming nature of the
structure. 
6. Change of Use
Except in residential districts, the ZBA may grant a special permit for a change of a lawful, pre-
existing, nonconforming use, provided the ZBA makes the findings set forth in Section VI.E.3.a. of
these Zoning Ordinances and the following mandatory findings: 
a. Said change in use is less detrimental to the abutting properties, ways, and the neighborhood than
the existing nonconformity; and
b. Sufficient mitigating measures will be implemented as a requirement of the special permit to
compensate for any adverse effects noted in reports from municipal boards; agencies; reports
from consultants; and information acquired from public hearings.
7. Non-use or Abandonment of a Nonconforming Use or Structure
Any use or structure loses its protection as nonconforming when the non-conformity is abandoned. 
a. Any nonconforming use or structure that is made conforming as to any aspect has abandoned the
nonconforming protection as to that aspect. 
b. Any nonconforming use that is not used for two years loses its protection as a pre-existing
nonconforming use. Any nonconforming structure that is not used for any purpose for two years
loses its protection as a pre-existing nonconforming structure. 
c. Evidence of abandonment may include, but shall not be limited to, one or more of the following, 
which shall not be conclusive of abandonment: 
(1) Removal of customary equipment or supplies for the operation of the use. 
(2) Discontinuance of electric, gas or other utility services. 
(3) The passage of two years after issuance of a notice of an unsafe structure by the building
inspector, without such condition having been repaired. 
(4) Failure to renew any certificate or license that is required for the conduct of business. 
8. Destruction or Damage or Non-conforming Commercial Buildings 
a. Destruction or Damage
A lawful, pre-existing, nonconforming single or two-family structure, which has been destroyed or
damaged by fire or other casualty may be re-established, restored or rebuilt within two years of
occurrence of the damage or destruction. Re-establishment, restoration or rebuilding shall be
permitted by-right provided that there is no increase in the degree of the non-conformity, and the
reconstruction conforms to the current requirements of these Zoning Ordinances to the maximum
extent practicable. 
A lawful, pre-existing, non-conforming structure or use other than a single or two-family structure, 
which has been destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty may be re-established, restored or
reconstructed within two years of occurrence of the damage or destruction. Re-establishment or
restoration of the pre-existing structure shall be allowed upon determination of the Building
Commissioner that the proposed re-establishment or restoration does not increase the non-conforming
nature of said structure. Reconstruction[URL: "#Page6"] 1 of the pre-existing structure shall only proceed if authorized
by a Special Permit granted by the ZBA. 
b. Change to Non-conforming Buildings or Structures, Other than Single or Two-Family
Structures 
1 Reconstruction shall be defined as complete replacement of the existing building, including foundation. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION I. PAGE 5 
Page 9
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION I. GENERAL 
The ZBA shall allow reconstruction, extension, and/or alteration of a lawful, pre-existing
nonconforming commercial structure, other than a single or two-family structure, when the ZBA finds
that the reconstruction, extension, and/or alteration does not increase nonconforming nature of the
structure. 
9. Unsafe Buildings
Nothing in these Zoning Ordinances shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of
any building, or part thereof, declared unsafe by the Building Commissioner. 
10. Exemptions from Dimensional Regulations
a. Single Lot Exemption for Single and Two-Family Use

2. Terms Not Defined
Terms not defined in this Section or elsewhere in these Zoning Ordinances but defined in the State
Building Code or in the Massachusetts General Laws shall have the meanings given therein unless a
contrary intention is clearly evident in these Zoning Ordinances. 
F. A Temporary Moratorium on New Construction and New Applications for Multi-Family
Dwellings within the City of Framingham
1. a. This moratorium shall cease all new construction and new applications blanketing those uses
defined as multi-family developments in all districts in which multi-family uses are permitted by
right and by special permit. This moratorium does not prohibit the construction of duplex units in
districts that are currently allowed. 
b. The purpose of this temporary moratorium is to allow for a reasonable time period to pause
new construction of multi-family developments in consideration of the 1,410 new units that have
been permitted since August 4, 2016 to February 27, 2020, with 876 being permitted in the
Central Business District. 
c. Such pause during this time where there is a current Covid-19 pandemic causing a shelter in

necessary studies to prepare a plan going forward. Such pause provides the City of Framingham
the necessary reasonable time period to study and address those critical ongoing issues of
concerns regarding traffic and transportation management, public safety, housing needs and
associated impacts that can be substantively examined and addressed without causing harm to the
ongoing initiative of revitalization of the City. 
d. The duration for such Moratorium shall be for a period of two hundred and seventy (270) days, 
such time period to toll beginning at the adoption date of this Moratorium signed into Order and

plans, such extension will not be longer than an additional ninety (90) days. 
It is noted that said moratorium is intended to allow time to develop implementation plans relative to
economic development and traffic and transportation plans.

 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION II. USE REGULATIONS 
A. Classes of Districts
For the purpose of these Zoning Ordinances, the City of Framingham is hereby divided into classes of
Zoning Districts as follows: 
1. Residence Districts: 
The purpose of the residential districts is to preserve the character of residential neighborhoods. The
City contains five different residential zoning districts: Single Residence (R-1), Single Residence (R-
2), Single Residence (R-3), Single Residence (R-4), and General Residence (G). Each district varies
in lot area, frontage, setbacks, open space percentage, and height requirements. The R-1 and the G
Districts contain the densest single family neighborhoods, while decreasing in density through to the
R-4 District which contains the least dense and largest lots within Framingham 
2. Business Districts
The purpose of the business districts is to offer a range of existing and proposed commercial and
mixed-uses specific to each district. The variety of business districts within the City supports a range
of small neighborhood villages to large commercial centers. The City contains five different business
zoning districts: Neighborhood Business (B-1), Community Business (B-2), General Business (B-3
and B-4), Central Business (CB), and Business (B).
a. Neighborhood Business: B-1
The purpose of the Neighborhood Business District is to preserve and encourage the provision of
small scale retail and service uses for nearby residential areas. Development within this District is
intended to be pedestrian-oriented and compatible with the scale of surrounding residential areas. 
This District reinforces historic preservation through the development of traditional neighborhood
village centers, with small lots, small setbacks, parking to the side or rear, and a mixed-use of
structures containing a variety of businesses. The B-1 District was established to protect adjacent
residential neighborhoods from the impacts and encroachment of large scale development. 
b. Community Business: B-2
The purpose of the Community Business District is to foster small commercial sites and compact
commercial centers which provide a variety of services to nearby residential neighborhoods and
the community. The emphasis of this District is on uses which will provide services for the
nearby residential areas. The B-2 District shall be primarily accessible and inviting to motorists, 
pedestrians, and bicyclists of all ages and abilities. The District allows for a full range of retail, 
service, and business uses with a local market area. The desired character includes areas which
are predominantly built-up, with buildings close to and oriented towards the sidewalk especially
at corners. Development is intended to be pedestrian-oriented and buildings with an improved
visual quality storefront are encouraged. 
c. General Business: B-3
The purpose of the General Business District is to foster business and commercial areas that
allows for the expansion of consolidated shopping centers and mixed-uses at the local and
regional scale. Development within the B-3 and B-4 District encourages the consolidation of
small parcels, to establish a high density building coverage, which aims to prevent the scattering
of small-lot developments. Furthermore, development is intended to be pedestrian oriented with a
strong emphasis on a safe and attractive streetscape. Buildings should be located along the street
frontage, with parking in the rear or to the side, while promoting shared-access driveways, 
circulation, and parking facilities where possible to increase the density of the building or
landscaped area and reduce traffic hazards. 
d. Nobscot Village District: B-4
The purpose of the Nobscot Village District is to foster and attract development opportunities that
lead to a direct investment into pivotal areas where junctions or crossroads exist. The intent is to
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION II. PAGE 23 
Page 27
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION II. USE REGULATIONS 
encourage redevelopment and reinvestment into a neighborhood center in order to re-establish
this area as fully integrated and functionally vibrant village center. The Nobscot Village District
shall include a mixture of various uses that are able to support and promote business and
community within the area. Uses are intended to complement one another and allow for different
offerings such as art and cultural spaces, public community space, educational/institutional use, 
entertainment, residential, office space, retail, and other small business enterprises. 
Streetscapes and façades are required to be designed to blend with the context of existing
neighborhoods in accordance with the respective design standards set forth for Nobscot Village, 
while aggressively promoting a walkable community that incorporates the use of bicycles and
other non-vehicular modes of transportation in order to reduce short-trip vehicular dependency. 
The Nobscot Village District is intended to provide all users with a live-work-play-learn
environment that accommodates all stages of life and all ability levels. 
The Nobscot Village District is surrounded by residential neighborhoods and open space lands. 
Any development and/or redevelopment within the Nobscot Village District shall be strongly
encouraged to be designed in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section II.K Nobscot
Village Zoning District Ordinance and Section IV.E.2. Table of Dimensional Regulations of these
Zoning Ordinances, to ensure the intent of the Nobscot Village District is maintained as
envisioned by the City of Framingham. Therefore, any relief and/or deviation from the previously
stated Sections of the Framingham Zoning Ordinances is strongly discouraged to ensure a project
remains in context with the vision of the Nobscot Village District. 
e. Central Business: CB
The purpose of the Central Business (CB) District is to stimulate a pedestrian- and transit-
oriented, mixed-use environment that is supported by a mixture of residential, retail, office, and
other commercial uses. The CB District encourages a compact, transit-oriented development
setting while preserving the area as the Framingham’s financial, civic, cultural, and government
center. The CB District is intended to generate a livable downtown environment with a strong
presence of a multitude of activities that increase pedestrian access and reduce the number of
auto-oriented uses. Development should preserve the historic nature and architecturally
significant buildings within the CB District, while promoting new and infill development to
support a multi-modal transportation, mixed-use environment. 
f. Business: B
The purpose of the Business District is to allow automobile oriented commercial development in
areas already predominantly built in this manner. The zone allows for a full range of retail and
service business within a local and regional market. The zone’s development standards promote
attractive development, an open and pleasant street appearance, and compatibility with adjacent
residential areas. Development is intended to be aesthetically pleasing for motorists, transit users, 
pedestrians, bicyclists, and the businesses owners. 
3. Office and Professional Districts: P
The purpose of the Office & Professional District is to serve as a transition zone between commercial, 
manufacturing, and residential zoning districts. The intent of this District is to accommodate
professional, medical, financial, and administrative uses while creating a design and landscape that is
harmonious with the adjacent residential uses. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION II. PAGE 24 
Page 28
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION II. USE REGULATIONS 
4. Planned Reuse Districts: PRD
The purpose of the Planned Reuse District is to encourage the appropriate reuse of land and buildings
that are no longer needed or suitable for their original use. This District applies only to land and
buildings in municipal ownership. Reuses are to be compatible with the character of the neighborhood
and must take into consideration the interests of abutters, neighbors, and the public, especially where
the site abuts a residential area or the building(s) merit preservation.
5. Manufacturing Districts
a. Light Manufacturing: M-1
The purpose of the Light Manufacturing District is to provide space for the expansion, attraction,
or retention of office, light industrial, research & development, manufacturing, service, and
warehouse uses; promoting the development of businesses which incorporate a mix of industrial
and commercial activities, including manufacturing and research & development, while
accommodating a wide range of other employment activities.
b. General Manufacturing: M
The purpose of the Manufacturing District is to provide areas within Framingham where research
& development, large scale corporations, and industrial uses may locate. It is the intent of these
Districts to promote viable and attractive industrial areas, with a campus style development,
promoting walkability, enhancing employment and economic vitality within the Districts. To
minimize conflict and preserve the Manufacturing District for its primary purposes, residential
uses are not permitted.
6. Open Space and Recreation Districts: OSR
The purpose of the Open Space and Recreation District is to encourage, preserve, and protect land for
recreational uses; and to conserve natural conditions, open space, wildlife and vegetation for the
general welfare of the public. Lands that are environmentally sensitive shall be preserved and
protected to ensure the continued health, safety, and welfare of the community and may serve as a
location for passive recreational activities. This District encourages the establishment of trails for
pedestrian and non-motorized activities.
7. Geriatric Care/Elderly Housing Districts: G-E
The purpose of the Geriatric Care/Elderly Housing District is to encourage the development of senior
housing that is compatible and complementary to its neighborhood scale and context, while providing
services and amenities required by seniors, and allows for and encourages neighborhood walkability.
Senior housing developments shall provide for superior functional design, quality of construction,
appearance, and operational standards.
8. Technology Park Districts: TP
The purpose of the Technology Park District is to allow lands suitable for technology production and
development, such as biotechnology, software and hardware development, and electronics, in addition
to industrial, professional office, research and development, and manufacturing uses that are part of a
master planned development project. Developments within the District shall be designed to provide a
pedestrian friendly environment, with a high attention to design and landscape detail.
9.a. Corporate Mixed-use District (CMU) 
The Corporate Mixed-use (CMU) District is intended to promote a mixture of uses that result in a vibrant
master-planned community. The CMU District shall be designed as a cohesive campus with high-density
development and/or redevelopment that integrates pedestrian-friendly and open space features, while
decreasing the need for the use of a personal automobile for trips within the CMU and the Technology
Park (TP) Zoning Districts. The CMU District is intended to enhance, support and promote retention of the
existing business community while providing additional business services to Framingham’s offerings as
an economic center. The CMU shall serve as an innovation center for additional employment

permitted in other zoning districts. In addition, these provisions are intended to ensure that the
technology park is served by a sufficient vehicular circulation network and infrastructure to meet the
particular demands of the facilities within the park without a corresponding impact on services in
surrounding residential neighborhoods and commercial areas in proximity to the park.

within the Technology Park District which must seek a Special Permit from the Planning Board
for Off-Street Parking or Site Plan Review. 
3. Permitted Uses
No building or structure shall be used, constructed or designed to be used in any part, and no change
shall be made in the use of land or premises, except as provided in Section II.B of these Zoning
Ordinances.

performing arts and retail facilities that may be constructed within the Park. 
G. ACCESSORY USES 
Accessory uses shall be such as do not alter the character of the premises on which they are located or
impair the neighborhood. 
Any use permitted as a principal use is also permitted as an accessory use provided such use is incidental to
and customarily found in connection with the principal use, building or structure and which is located on the
same lot with the principal use, building or structure. Any use authorized as a principal use by a SPGA may
also be authorized as an accessory use by the same SPGA provided such use is incidental to and customarily
found in connection with the principal use, building or structure on the same lot with the principal use, 
building or structure. 
Any use not allowed in a zoning district as a principal use is also prohibited as an accessory use. An
accessory use is permitted only in connection with a lawfully existing principal use. A use or activity which
is prohibited in the zoning district shall also be expressly prohibited as an accessory use. 
In any instance where site plan review approval is required for a principal use, the addition of any new
use accessory to the principal use, where such addition exceeds the thresholds established in Section
VI.F.2., shall also require site plan review approval as amended from time to time. 
H. TRAILERS

I. CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT 
1. The Central Business (CB) District design standards have been developed to promote quality
development that preserves and enhances Downtown Framingham’s history and character; and further
encourages a walkable, pedestrian- and transit-oriented environment. These design standards are
integral to the CB District regulations and must be met as part of any CB District site plan review and
approval[URL: "#Page44"] 1.
2. The Planning Board may require applicants, in need of a special permit for use in the CB District, to
utilize façade easements in order to protect the values of historic structures. Such requirement would
be applicable only where a development proposal, associated with such special permit, would result
in the demolition or major exterior renovation of buildings, which are listed on the Inventory of
Cultural Resources or are in a National Register District. 
3. To further enhance the development of the CB District applicants are encouraged to utilize the
“Central Business (CB) Zoning District Design Guidelines,” of the Planning Board’s Rules and
Regulations. 
4. Development within the CB District that requires site plan review and/or special permit shall be
subject to the following design regulations. Framingham encourages projects that does not require site
plan review and/or special permit approval to incorporate the design regulations and standards into
their projects.

1. Purpose and Intent
The Corporate Mixed-use (CMU) District is designed to encourage a mixed-use, master planned
community that supports commercial, office, manufacturing, research & development, retail, education, 
community space, open space, and mixed-use opportunities. The CMU is intended to provide the tools
and support for both entrepreneurs seeking new business enterprise opportunities as well as those
established businesses seeking to meet existing and future expansion goals. These regulations have been
established to promote an efficient and predictable review process for developers while ensuring a well-
designed community for Framingham. 
The CMU District is intended to function as an employment center that will possess a high quality diverse
workforce while establishing a mixed-use environment where users can work, play, socialize, and study.

as key economic centers for a variety of businesses that can support each other, while creating space for
entrepreneurs. The purpose of a village center is to provide a central area of commerce that will benefit
the neighboring region by supporting local residents, visitors, and the community as a whole. 
To establish Nobscot as a village center the Nobscot Village (B-4) District has been developed as follows: 
a. Provide a vibrant walkable mixed-use center that may include art and cultural galleries/studios, 
community space, educational/institutional space, amenity space, entertainment, office space, 
residential, retail, a mixture of business opportunities. 
b. Encourage adaptive reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underutilized properties that will re-energize the
neighborhood. 
c. Inspire development and support a mixture of businesses and entrepreneurs though targeted
workspaces, while allowing the surrounding community to take advantage of business opportunities, 
job creation, and economic resources. 
d. Develop parcels at an appropriate density that supports the vision of a neighborhood village while
encouraging ongoing investment and reinvestment in properties within the B-4 District. 
e. Allow for a mixture of uses that can support one another while attracting visitors to utilize the
amenities and services offered within the Village. 
f. Advance an integrated neighborhood community that supports and encourages trails, public
transportation, and bicycle-oriented modes of transportation for short trips and recreational
opportunities. 
g. Investigate and nurture educational and civic opportunities that can sustain viability within the
community while growing its user base. 
h. Preserve, enhance, and provide opportunities that repurpose historical structures and retain a piece of
the neighborhood’s history for future uses and events, while supporting opportunities for the structure
to flourish and thrive as a new use.

2. Applicability
a. All proposed development in a Floodplain District shall require a permit from the Building
Commissioner. 
b. In addition to a permit from the Building Commissioner, any construction, enlargement, 
extension, or substantial improvement of a new or existing building for human habitation, 
normally allowed by right or authorized by special permit in a land area underlying a Floodplain
District, shall require a special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA).
c. In the regulatory floodway, any development or encroachment, including fill, which would result
in any increase in flood levels during the base flood shall be prohibited. In Zones A and AE, 
along watercourses that have not had a regulatory floodway designated, the best available
Federal, State, local, or other floodway data shall be used to prohibit encroachments in floodways
which would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of
the base flood discharge. 
d. Base flood elevation data is required for subdivision proposals or other developments greater than
50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, within unnumbered A zones. All subdivision proposals
must be designed to assure that: 
(1) Such proposals minimize flood damage; 
(2) All public utilities and facilities are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage; and 
(3) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
3. Application Procedure
Prior to the filing of an application subject to this section, the applicant shall submit plans to the
Building Commissioner. The Commissioner shall advise the applicant as to the pertinent sections of
these Zoning Ordinances and the State Building Code, 780 CMR. If a special permit is required, the
applicant shall then submit seven copies of the application to the ZBA, who shall forthwith transmit
one copy each to the City Clerk, the Conservation Commission, the Board of Health, the Department
of Public Works, the division of Planning & Community Development, and the Planning Board. Such

B. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
1. Purpose and Intent
The purpose and intent of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to allow by special permit
from the Planning Board an alternative use and pattern of land development for large tracts of land
zoned for manufacturing, light manufacturing or business, by allowing single-family and multi-family
clustered residential development and other uses as permitted in this Section while encouraging the
conservation of significant open space in the district and providing affordable housing opportunity, all
in conformance with the provisions of M.G.L. Chapter 40A, Section 9. The PUD is a flexible zoning
tool designed to meet the following public objectives: 
a. to preserve significant areas of open space in perpetuity; 
b. to encourage housing and land development which is harmonious with natural features and the
environment; 
c. to encourage a variety of housing types, sizes, characteristics, and price ranges; 
d. to provide affordable housing to meet the housing needs of persons of low and moderate income; 
e. to allow a limited neighborhood commercial area for the convenience of residents within the PUD
District; 
f. to provide recreational facilities within the District; 
g. to promote more efficient uses of land and to preserve and protect natural resources such as
wetland areas, woodlands, fields, natural habitats, significant vegetation, water bodies, and water
supplies; and, 
h. to preserve sites and structures of historical importance. 
In the PUD, dwelling units should be constructed in appropriate clusters which are harmonious with
neighborhood development and will not detract from the ecological and visual qualities of the
environment. The overall site design and amenities should enhance the quality of living for the
residents of the development and the city generally. Attention shall be given by the Planning Board as
to whether the proposed site design, development layout, number, type and design of housing
constitutes a suitable development for the neighborhood within which it is to be located. 
2. Applicability
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 66 
Page 70
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
The Planned Unit Development District is an overlay district that may be superimposed upon a parcel
or contiguous parcels of land having an area of at least fifty acres and located within a “M” General
Manufacturing, “B” Business, or “M-1” Light Manufacturing, district by a vote of at least two-thirds
of the City Council. The area to be included within the PUD District may include strips of land not to
exceed one-hundred feet in width through any zoning district solely for the purpose of providing
access to the parcel from public streets. Any roadway within said access strip shall include suitable
plantings or materials to provide a visual buffer between the road and adjacent uses. If City Council
votes to place such a parcel of land in an overlay PUD District, the applicant thereof may file an
application for a special permit with the SPGA in accordance with the requirements of Section
III.B.9. of these Zoning Ordinances. The application for a PUD Special Permit shall include the entire
parcel or parcels placed into the PUD District by vote of the City Council. The SPGA shall not accept
applications for a special permit under this Section which do not include the entire parcel or parcels of
land designated as a PUD District. In the event a PUD Special Permit is issued pursuant to this
Section and the rights granted pursuant thereto are exercised by the owner/applicant, no land included
within said district may be removed from the provisions of this Section and used in accordance with
the underlying zoning district. 
3. Definitions
a. Terms Defined
For the purpose of this PUD Ordinance, the following terms shall have the meanings given in the
following clauses: 
Affordable Housing Unit: A housing unit offered for either sale or rental at such terms, 
conditions and restrictions so as to be qualified as affordable to persons or families of low or
moderate income by the Executive Office of Communities and Development of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (EOCD). Said units shall be offered for sale or rental by or
through one or more of the following: a program administered by the EOCD; the Framingham
Housing Authority; a non-profit land trust or limited dividend entity; each such affordable
housing unit shall be governed by adequate and enforceable deed restrictions or other agreements
acceptable to the Planning Board ensuring the continuing affordability of the unit. Affordable
housing units shall be compatible with and nearly indistinguishable from the exterior appearance
of the market-rate units in the PUD district and should be located throughout the PUD district. 
Applicant: The person or persons, including a corporation or other legal entity, who applies for
issuance of a special permit hereunder. The applicant must own, or be the beneficial owner of, all
the land included in the planned development site proposed, or have authority from the owner(s)

b. Terms Not Defined
Any terms not defined in this Section but defined elsewhere in these Zoning Ordinance sor in the
State Building Code or in Massachusetts General Laws shall have the meanings given therein to
the extent the same are not inconsistent with this Section. 
4. Basic Requirements
a. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance to the contrary, no building permit shall be
issued for, and no person shall undertake, any use or improvement in a PUD District unless an
application for a special permit has been prepared for the proposed development in accordance
with the requirements of this Section, and unless such special permit has been approved by the
SPGA. The SPGA for a special permit granted under this Section shall be the Planning Board. 
b No occupancy permit shall be granted by the Building Commissioner until the Planning Board
has given its approval that the development or any phase thereof and any associated off-site
improvements conform to the approved application for a special permit under this Section
including any conditions imposed by the Planning Board. No temporary occupancy permits shall
be granted under this PUD District Ordinance. 
c. If a PUD special permit is not applied for within 3 years of a City Council vote to create a PUD
overlay zone for a parcel of land, such land shall, after said three years, not be eligible for a PUD
special permit. The City Council may, by two-thirds vote, extend this time limit. 
5. Permitted Uses
No building or structure shall be constructed, used or arranged or designed to be used in any part and
no change shall be made in the use of land or premises except for one or more of the following
purposes: 
a. Single-family detached and attached residences, multifamily residential buildings and congregate
housing for the elderly, including a long term health care facility associated therewith. Not less
than ten percent (10%) of all such housing units, including units for both sale and rental, shall
qualify as affordable housing as said term is defined in Section III.B.3. of these Zoning
Ordinances. Each phase of the development shall have approximately ten percent (10%) of its
units qualify as affordable, and said affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the
development and in various housing types. Not more than twenty percent of the housing units
within the PUD District, exclusive of any congregate housing units for the elderly and affordable
housing units, shall be rental units. The remainder of the units shall be owner-occupied. 
b. Neighborhood commercial uses intended for the primary use and convenience of the residents
within the PUD District as defined in Section III.B.3. of these Zoning Ordinances . As a general
rule, no such establishment shall occupy more than 2,500 square feet and shall be subject to
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 68 
Page 72
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
reasonable restrictions and conditions relating to size and hours of operation imposed by the
Planning Board. The Planning Board may refuse to authorize a commercial use which in its
judgment is inappropriate for location within the PUD District. The Planning Board may permit
larger neighborhood commercial establishments, up to a limit of 4,000 square feet, based on a
clear demonstration by the applicant and a finding by the Planning Board that such larger size
meets the needs of the residents in the PUD District. 
c. Recreational facilities intended for the primary use and convenience of the residents thereof, such
as swimming pools, exercise facilities, tennis courts and athletic fields (but not including driving
ranges, miniature golf, or commercial amusement parks which are not permitted).
6. Dimensional and Area Regulations
a. Applicability
The dimensional and area regulations set forth in this Section shall apply to the total area of
developable land within the PUD District and shall not regulate individual lots therein. 
b. Maximum Allowable Density
The total number of residential housing units shall not exceed seven per acre of developable land
within the PUD District. For purposes of this density calculation, every two bedrooms within a
congregate housing facility as defined in Section III.B.3. these Zoning Ordinances shall be
counted as one residential housing unit. Notwithstanding the aforesaid density limitations, the
Planning Board may reduce the maximum allowable density within a PUD District; provided, 
however, that any such reduction be limited to that which is reasonably necessary to satisfy the
objectives of a PUD District as defined herein. The Planning Board may also take into
consideration the density of development on land surrounding the PUD District and the presence, 
or lack thereof, of undevelopable land and open space contained within and abutting the PUD
District. 
c. Floor Area Ratio Requirement
The ratio of the gross floor area of all buildings, residential and commercial, within the PUD
District, to the total area of developable land within the District shall not exceed 32% (0.32).
d. Ground Coverage Requirement
(1) The ground coverage of all residential and commercial buildings and parking lots and
impervious landscaping within the PUD District shall not exceed 40% of the total area of
developable land within the District. The ground coverage of all roadway areas and
associated sidewalks shall be excluded from this requirement. 
(2) The ground coverage of all land and buildings used for commercial purposes, including
associated parking lots, loading areas and impervious landscaping within the PUD District
shall not exceed 2% of the developable land area of the District. 
e. Setback Requirements
Setbacks within PUD Districts shall conform to the following requirements; provided, however, 
that the Planning Board may reduce the setback requirements or may require greater setbacks to
provide additional buffers to residences abutting the PUD District or to enhance the aesthetic
appearance or planning objectives of this project. 
(1) Setbacks Abutting Other Districts
All structures within a PUD District shall have a minimum setback requirement of 50 feet
from the PUD District boundary line. 
(2) Front Setback Requirements

Page 73
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
All buildings within the PUD District shall have a setback of at least 30 feet from any
other building therein. The required setback for any building which exceeds forty feet in
height shall equal to the height of that building. 
f. Maximum Height Requirement
The maximum height of any building in a PUD District shall not exceed three stories or forty feet
except for accessory structures or appurtenances normally built above the roof level and
necessary for the operation of the building or use. Such structures shall not be intended for human
occupancy and shall be erected only to serve the purpose for which they are intended. Except for
chimneys and penthouses for stairways and mechanical installations, no such accessory structure
or appurtenance shall exceed a height of 40 feet from the average grade.

wetlands in accordance with the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. Ch.131 Section
40) and the Regulations of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) promulgated
thereunder, including the wildlife protection regulations, shall be designated as “Public Open
Space”. Said areas shall be preserved as open space in perpetuity and either conveyed to the
Framingham Conservation Commission, or to a non-profit organization whose principal purpose
is the conservation of open space, or shall be protected by means of a conservation restriction
imposed on the land pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 184, Section 31. 
c. Common Open Space
A minimum of 25% of the total developable land within the PUD District, exclusive of land set
aside for streets within the district, shall be designated “Common Open Space”. Common Open
Space shall include all developable land not dedicated to roads, parking areas, buildings and
structures. At least 50% of the required common open space shall be suitable for passive or active
recreational use by residents of the PUD District. Common Open Space may be used for
recreational facilities, as delineated in Section III.B.5.(c); and for passive open space and buffer
areas. Common open space shall have a shape, dimension, character and location suitable to
assure its use for park, recreation, conservation or agricultural purposes by residents of the PUD
district; and, where possible, be located such that significant areas of continuous open space are
distributed throughout the PUD District. There shall also be significant areas of common open
space near areas containing high concentrations of housing units. 
The approximate location of major areas of Public Open Space and Common Open Space shall be
identified as part of the Preliminary Development Plan. The granting of a special permit for this
plan shall include as a condition that the large areas of open space identified on the Preliminary
Development Plan be preserved approximately as shown, with the understanding that the precise
definition of such open space might be altered with the submittal and approval of Definitive
Development Plans. 
d. Ownership of Common Open Space, Restrictions Thereon
The required open land shall be conveyed to a non-profit corporation or trust comprising a
condominium or homeowner’s association. In order to ensure that the association will properly
maintain the land deeded to it under this section, the developer shall cause to be recorded at the

Middlesex South District Registry of Deeds a Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions which
shall, at a minimum, provide for the following: 
(1) mandatory membership in an established association, as a requirement of ownership of any
condominium unit, rental unit, building or lot in the tract. 
(2) provisions for maintenance, assessments of the owners of all condominium units, rental units, 
buildings or lots in order to ensure that the open land is maintained in a condition suitable for
the uses approved by the home's association. Failure to pay such assessment shall create a
lien on the property assessed, enforceable by the association. 
(3) provisions which, so far as possible under the existing law, will ensure that the restrictions
placed on the use of the open land will not terminate by operation of law. 
(4) provisions for limited easements to significant areas of open space and natural resources for
recreational use by residents of Framingham, and to provide linkages to open space of
abutting properties. 
The developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of the common land and any other
facilities to be held in common until such time as the association is capable of assuming said
responsibility.

E. HIGHWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
1. Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the Highway Overlay District Regulations Ordinance is to manage the intensity of
development and the quality of design along major highway corridors so as to protect the public
health, welfare and safety and to enhance the economic vitality of the area. In particular, the
provisions set forth are designed to limit congestion, to preserve environmental qualities, to improve
pedestrian and vehicular circulation, and to provide for mitigation of any adverse impacts resulting
from increased development in a complex regional center. In addition to these purposes, the open
space and landscaping provisions of this section are designed to foster development that is of high
visual and aesthetic quality. 
Furthermore, it is a specific purpose of this Ordinance to establish parallel and consistent zoning
regulations for highway corridor areas which are shared by the municipalities of both Framingham
and Town of Natick, in order to achieve a unified development character for such areas and to avoid
substantive and procedural conflicts in the regulation and administration of land uses within such
areas. 
This Ordinance establishes a system whereby a development may attain a greater density than
allowed by right, in return for providing public benefit amenities which compensate for one or more
specific effects of increased density. These amenities may include traffic improvements (to
accommodate increased traffic), pedestrian or transit improvements (to reduce traffic generation),
creation of additional open space and public parks (to compensate for increased congestion and
concentration of economic activities), provision of public assembly areas (to foster more balanced
development and a sense of community).
The provision of increased development density in return for such amenities is specifically authorized
by MGL Ch. 40A, Sec. 9, with respect to open space, traffic and pedestrian amenities, and is also
generally authorized for other amenities. 
2. Definitions
The following terms shall be specifically applicable to these Highway Overlay District Regulation
Ordinance and shall have the meanings provided below. 
Bonus: The construction of floor area in excess of that permitted as of right by the applicable FAR
maximum. 
Bonus Project: A project for which the applicant is seeking any one or more of the bonuses provided
in Section III.E.9 of these Zoning Ordinances. 
Change In Use: A change in part or all of an existing structure from one use category or purpose to
another use category or purpose. In a mixed or multi-use facility, an exchange or rearrangement of
principal use categories or components shall not be construed as a change in use unless the net change
in any of the factors in the [Table of Off-Street Parking Regulations, Section IV.B.1(a)], requires an
addition of 10 or more parking spaces to the amount required by this Ordinance prior to the change in
use. 
Divider Island: A landscaped element running in a direction parallel to a vehicular travel lane, used
to separate parallel rows of parking spaces. 
Excess Pervious Landscaping: Pervious landscaping exclusive of wetlands, as defined herein, in
excess of the amount required by the applicable LSR. 
Floor Area Ratio (FAR): The ratio between (1) the gross floor area of all buildings on a parcel, 
including accessory buildings, and (2) the total area of the parcel. 
Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR): The ratio between (1) the area of a parcel devoted to pervious
landscaping or natural vegetated areas and (2) the total area of the parcel. Both components of this
ratio shall exclude any wetland resource area, as defined in M.G.L. Ch. 131, Sec. 40, except for

3. Establishment of Districts
a. General
The Highway Overlay Districts are established as districts which overlay nonresidential zoning
districts abutting major arterial highways. There are two such overlay districts: the REGIONAL
CENTER (RC) Overlay District and the HIGHWAY CORRIDOR (HC) Overlay District. 
b. Regional Center (RC) District
1) The RC district shall be bounded as follows: 
•  Easterly by the Framingham-Natick municipal boundary; 
•  Southerly by the boundary line between the General Business district and the R-1 Single
Residence district on the southerly side of Worcester Road (State Route 9);
•  Westerly by the intersection of Worcester Road and Cochituate Road (Route 30);
•  The Northerly boundary shall include all parcels, or groups of contiguous parcels serving
a common use, whether or not in common ownership, which are used for non-residential
purposes as of January 1, 1992 and any portions of which are located within 200 feet of
that portion of the northerly right-of-way of Cochituate Road, between Worcester Road
(Route 9) and the Framingham-Natick municipal boundary
2) If, as of January 1, 1992, any portion of the area of a parcel falls within the RC district, then
the entire parcel shall be deemed to fall within the district. 
c. Highway Corridor (HC) District
The HC District shall include all parcels, or groups of contiguous parcels serving a common use, 
whether or not in common ownership, which are used for non-residential purposes as of January
1, 1992 and any portions of which are located within 200 feet of the right-of-way of Worcester
Road (Route 9), but excluding (a) parcels that are included in the RC district as set forth above; 
(b) parcels located on the northerly side of Worcester Road between Edgell Road and the
westerly ramp leading onto Route 9 (the Framingham Center); (c) the parcels known as the
Framingham Industrial Park; and (d) and the parcels known as 9/90 Crossing. 
d. Relationship to Underlying Districts
1) The Highway Overlay Districts shall overlay, all underlying districts, so that any parcel of
land lying in a Highway Overlay District shall also lie in one or more of the other zoning
districts in which it was previously classified, as provided for in these Zoning Ordinances. 
2) All regulations of the underlying zoning districts shall apply within the Highway Overlay
Districts, except to the extent that they are specifically modified or supplemented by other
provisions of the applicable Highway Overlay District. 
3) Requirements for off-site contributions under Site Plan Review: 
a) For non-bonus projects, the requirements of Sections VI.F.6(a) and VI.F.8.(c) regarding
contributions for off-site improvements shall apply. 
b) For bonus projects which comply in all other respects with the requirements of this
Section E. and other provisions of these Zoning Ordinances, the provisions of this
Section E. regarding contributions for off-site improvements and public benefit amenities
shall supersede and replace the requirement for off-site improvements under Section
VI.F.6.(a) and VI.F.8.(c).
4. Use Regulations
a. General
1) The Highway Overlay Districts are herein established as overlay districts. The
underlying permitted uses are permitted. However a developer must meet the additional
requirements of this Section III.E of these Zoning Ordinances. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 84 
Page 88
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
2) Lots in a Highway Overlay District exclusively used or zoned for single or two-family
residential development are exempt from these regulations, regardless of the underlying
Zoning District classification. 
b. Multiple Use Developments
Multiple use developments are specifically allowed in a Highway Overlay District to the extent
that each individual use is allowed in the district. 
5. Intensity Regulations
a. Base Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for Nonresidential Development
For any nonresidential development, the floor area ratio (FAR) shall not exceed 0.32, except as
modified below in this section. 
b. Increase in FAR for New Construction with Public Benefit Amenities in the RC District
The Planning Board may, by Special Permit, grant an increase in the maximum floor area ratio
above 0.32, up to a maximum FAR of 0.40, for parcels located in the Regional Center (RC) 
zoning district, subject to the following requirements: 
1) Increased pervious landscape surface shall be provided in accordance with Section
III.E.6(b) of these Highway Overlay Districts Regulations. 
2) Public benefit amenities shall be provided as required herein, and the increase in
permitted floor area shall be determined in accordance with the schedule of bonuses set
forth in Section 9 of these Highway Overlay Districts Regulations. A FAR increase shall
be granted only if the Board makes the Findings required in Section III.E.5.g of these
Ordinances. 
c. Increase in FAR for Consolidation of Lots in the RC or HC Districts
In order to encourage consolidation of lots, the Planning Board may, by special permit, grant an
increase in the floor area ratio above 0.32. Such increase shall not exceed 20% of the combined
gross floor area of the buildings on the lots to be consolidated, or 12,000 square feet, whichever is
lesser, up to a maximum FAR of 0.40. 
A FAR increase shall be granted only if the Planning Board determines that the proposed
consolidation will achieve, to the maximum extent feasible, the Objectives and Standards set
forth in Section III.E.5.c.1) and makes the Findings required in Section III.E.5.g of these
Ordinances. 
1) Objectives and Standards
a) The coordinated development shall be designed to provide access improvements and
reduce the number of curb cuts as well as improve signage, unify landscaping, and
achieve a higher standard of site design than would be possible with separate
development of the individual lots. 
b) Only lots which were in separate ownership as of January 1, 1992 may be consolidated
for purposes of qualifying for a FAR increase in a Highway Overlay District. 
c) The coordinated development need not involve consolidation of ownership. However, the
continued use of improvements achieved through consolidation must be guaranteed
through appropriate mechanisms (such as easements).
d. Increase in FAR for Projects Involving Minor Alterations in the RC or HC Districts
The Planning Board may, by Special Permit, grant an increase in the existing FAR over 0.32 for
minor alteration up to a maximum FAR of 0.40. Such increase shall be granted only if the Planning
Board makes Findings required in Section III.E.5.g of these Zoning Ordinances. A special permit, 
under Section III.E of these Zoning Ordinances, is not required for a minor alteration which does not
exceed a FAR of 0.32. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 85 
Page 89
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
e. Areas Excluded from FAR Computation
The floor area of the following types of facilities shall not be included in the gross floor area of a
structure or structures for the purposes of computing the floor area ratio on a parcel in the HC or RC
district: 
1) Day care facilities licensed by the State Office for Children
2) Off-street parking facilities and associated ramps and aisles; 
3) Facilities dedicated to public or private transit facilities, or to trip reduction activities such as
carpooling and van pooling. Such facilities may include waiting areas, ticket offices or offices
for the administration of transportation management and trip reduction activities. 
4) Cafeterias for the primary use of the employees who work at the site. 
f. Density on Parcels Where Portion Dedicated to Framingham or the Commonwealth
Subject to the other provisions of this section, if the owner of a parcel, with the concurrence of the
Planning Board, dedicates to Framingham or the Commonwealth a portion of the parcel for public
ownership of a bonus facility, then the permissible density at which the remainder of the parcel may
be developed shall be based on the total parcel area including the area so dedicated. 
g. Findings Required for a FAR Increase
In granting a FAR increase the Planning Board shall make a specific Finding, in writing, that the
increase shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing structure or
use, and in the case of new construction, that the increase shall not be substantially more detrimental
to the neighborhood than the project at the Base FAR, and that all of the conditions set forth below
are met. As the basis for its decision, the Planning Board shall consider factors which shall include, 
but not be limited to, the impact of the waiver on traffic; municipal services and facilities; the
character of the neighborhood including environmental and visual features. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate conformance with the following standards as part of the
request for a FAR increase. 
1) The increase will achieve the goals, objectives and intent of these Highway Overlay District
Regulations. 
2) The increase will achieve compliance with these Highway Overlay District Regulations to a
substantially greater degree as compared with the degree of compliance present in the existing
development. In the case of new construction, the increase will achieve compliance with these
Highway Overlay District Regulations to a substantially greater degree as compared to
development at the Base FAR. 
3) The proposed development complies with all other applicable requirements set forth in these
Zoning Ordinances, including, when required, site plan review (Section VI.F) and/or off-street
parking requirements in Section IV., thereof, subject to the following exception: 
That such requirements are specifically superseded by these Highway Overlay Districts
Regulations, 
6. Open Space Requirements
a. Base Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR) 
The base landscape surface ratio (LSR) shall be 0.20 for retail, consumer service and
manufacturing uses, and 0.40 for office, research and development and other similar non-retail, 
nonresidential uses. 
b. Increased LSR for Bonus Projects
For bonus projects, the minimum required landscape surface ratio shall be the sum of (1) the base
LSR specified above for the applicable use, and (2) one-half of the difference between the
proposed FAR and 0.32. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 86 
Page 90
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
c. Multiple Use Projects
The minimum required LSR for multiple use developments shall be computed as a blended ratio
of the LSR requirements applying to the individual components of the development, as follows: 
1) Non-bonus projects: 
Minimum LSR= (Retail, service or manufacturing floor area percentage x 0.20) + (Office, R&D or
other similar non-retail, non-residential uses floor area percentage x 0.40) 
2) Bonus projects: 
Minimum LSR=[(Retail, service or manufacturing floor area percentage x 0.20) 
+ (Office, R&D or other similar non-retail, non-residential uses floor area percentage x 0.40)]
+ (one-half of the difference between the proposed FAR and 0.32) 
d. Applicability
The requirements of this Section III.E.6 shall apply to any new structure which requires ten or
more parking spaces, and to any major alteration, or change of use of an existing structure which
requires the addition of ten or more parking spaces. 
7. Dimensional Regulations

equal to or greater than 200 but less than 300 feet 50 feet. 
equal to or greater than 300 but less than 400 feet 60 feet. 
equal to or greater than 400 feet  80 feet
b. Setbacks: 
1) Minimum front setbacks shall be as specified for the underlying zoning district(s).
2) Structures shall be set back a minimum of fifteen feet from all side and rear property lines, 
or the setback required by the underlying zoning, whichever is greater, except as modified
by subparagraph c., below. 
c. Where Abutting Residential Districts
The minimum setbacks for structures located adjacent to residential districts shall be thirty feet. 
8. Landscaping Requirements
a. General Purpose and Intent
The requirements and standards set forth in this Section III.E.8 are intended to achieve specific
performance objectives, as described below, to enhance the visual quality of the areas within the
Highway Overlay Districts, to encourage the creation and protection of open space, to avoid
expansive development of impervious surfaces, to protect and preserve the area's ecological
balance and to ensure that landscaping is an integral part of development. In the event the
applicant desires to deviate from the specific standards set forth below, the Planning Board may
approve alternative plans if it finds that such alternative is clearly more feasible and/or preferable
and that the proposed arrangement meets the general purpose, intent, and objectives of this
Section III.E.8. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 87 
Page 91
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
b. Objectives
In order to accomplish the General Purpose and Intent of these Highway Overlay Districts
Regulations specific objectives shall be accomplished by landscape plans, which shall include the
following: 
1) Buffer strips at the front of lots shall contribute to the creation of tree-lined roadways and
shall create a strong impression of separation between the street and the developed area of
the site without necessarily eliminating visual contact between them. 
2) Buffer strips adjoining or facing residential uses or residential zoning districts shall provide
the strongest possible visual barrier between uses at pedestrian level and create a strong
impression of spatial separation. 
3) Landscaping within parking areas shall provide visual and climatic relief from broad
expanses of pavement and shall be designed to define logical areas for pedestrian and
vehicular circulation and to channel such movement on and off the site. 
4) All required landscaping shall be located entirely within the bounds of the parcel. 
5) To the greatest feasible extent, existing healthy, mature vegetation shall be retained in place
or transplanted and reused on site. 
c. Applicability
The requirements of this Section III.E.8 shall apply to any new structure which requires ten or
more parking spaces, and to any major alteration, or change of use of an existing structure which
requires the addition of ten or more parking spaces. 
d. Technical Requirements
All off-street parking site plans and special permits required hereunder shall include a landscape
plan and planting schedule prepared by a registered landscape architect unless waived in
accordance with Section III.E.10.b. 
e. Occupancy Permits
1) No occupancy permit, whether temporary or permanent, shall be granted by the Building
Commissioner, until the Planning Board has voted its approval that all landscaping and
buffer strips conform to the approved landscape plan and planting schedule, or thirty days
shall have passed since the request was submitted to the Planning Board. 
2) In cases where, because of seasonal conditions or other unforeseeable circumstances, it is
not possible to install or complete landscaping prior to initial occupancy of the building(s),
an occupancy permit may be granted by the Building Commissioner, upon the approval of
the Planning Board, under the following conditions: 
a) the owner shall make a payment to the City, to be held in escrow by the Planning Board, 
to ensure that required landscape planting is installed and maintained
b) the amount of the escrow payment shall be set by the Planning Board and shall be equal
to the remaining estimated cost of materials and installation, with allowance for
escalation and contingencies. 
3) Release of any escrow amounts, or approval of issuance of an occupancy permit, shall be
conditioned upon the receipt by the Planning Board of written certification by a registered
landscape architect that the specified plant materials to be included in the project
landscaping have been installed according to the approved landscape plan. 
f. Landscaped Buffer Strips
1) General Standards
In the highway corridor and regional center areas, a landscaped buffer strip shall be provided
separating all buildings, parking areas, vehicular circulation facilities, or similar
improvements from the right-of-way line of any public street, or any private way which is
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 88 
Page 92
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
adjudged by the Planning Board to perform an equivalent function. Plantings in landscaped
buffer strips shall be arranged to provide maximum protection to adjacent properties and to
avoid damage to existing plant material. The landscaped buffer strip shall include the
required planting as set forth herein, and shall be continuous except for required vehicular
access points and pedestrian circulation facilities. All required landscaping amenities shall be
located within the bounds of the parcel. Signs shall be designed to be integrated into the
landscaping. 
2) Specific Standards
a) Depth 
Unless a greater depth of landscaping is required in the underlying zoning district, 
landscaped buffer strips shall be one-third of the distance between the street right-of-way
and any building line, but shall not be less than fifteen feet in depth, and need not be
greater than fifty feet in depth. Sidewalks may be considered in the calculation of the
buffer depth. Landscaped buffer strips adjoining or facing residential districts or
residential uses shall be a minimum of fifteen feet in depth. 
b) Composition
The buffer strip shall include a combination of deciduous and/or evergreen trees and
lower-level elements such as shrubs, hedges, grass, ground cover, fences, planted berms, 
brick or stone walls. When necessary for public safety or to prevent adverse impacts on
neighboring properties, the Planning Board may require that the buffer strip contain
opaque screening. 
c) Arrangement
Arrangements may include planting in linear, parallel, serpentine, or broken rows, as well
as the clustering of planting elements. The following provisions set forth the form of
arrangement of plantings. The form of plant arrangement is as follows: 
1) At least one tree shall be provided per twenty-seven linear feet of street frontage or
portion thereof. There shall be a minimum of three trees in the entire buffer strip. 
Trees may be evenly spaced or grouped. Groups of trees shall be spaced no further
apart than fifty feet. 
2) At least four shrubs shall be provided per one hundred square feet of landscaped area
in the buffer strip. 
d) Opaque Screens
An opaque screen may be comprised of walls, fences, berms, or evergreen plantings, or
any combination thereof, providing that the Planning Board may require evergreen trees
or shrubs instead of fences when deemed appropriate. Opaque screens shall be opaque in
all seasons of the year. For developments adjoining or facing residential districts or
residential uses, or when necessary for public safety or to prevent adverse impacts on
neighboring properties, a buffer strip shall contain opaque screens as follows: 
1) The screen shall be opaque from the ground to a height of between two and one-half
to six feet when planted or installed as determined by the Planning Board. 
2) Walls or fences exceeding four and one-half feet in height shall have plantings on the
side facing the residential district, and may be required to have plantings on both
sides. 
3) Evergreen trees or shrubs shall be spaced not more than five feet on center. 
4) The Planning Board may require ornamental or shade trees in addition to an opaque
screen, planted in conformity with the standards set forth in Section III.E8.f.2) c) 
above, depending upon the type, size and proximity of adjoining residential uses. 
e) Berms 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 89 
Page 93
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
When berms are used to meet the requirements for a buffer strip they shall be planted with
living vegetation. The minimum top width of a berm shall be three feet, and the maximum
side slope shall be 3:1. No more than twenty-five per cent (25%) of the coverage of a planted
berm shall be mulch or non-living material. 
f) Mulches
When used in required landscaping or buffers, mulches shall be limited to bark mulch or
decorative stone. No more than twenty-five per cent (25%) of the coverage of the landscaped
area shall be mulch or non-living material. 
g. Intersection Sight Distance Restrictions
Landscaped buffers and screening shall not restrict sight distances at intersections or driveway
entrances. Site distance requirements, location and specification of site zones shall be determined
by reference to the current edition of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public
Works Highway Design Manual, or any successor publication. As a guide, no fence or other
structure may be erected, and no vegetation may be maintained, between a plane two and one-half
feet above curb level and a plane seven feet above intersecting roadway levels within the zone
required for site distance, subject however to actual roadway profiles of the intersecting streets
and/or driveways. 
h. Landscaping within Off-Street Parking Areas
1) Standards for Landscaping Within Parking Areas: 
a) Parking areas shall be broken into sections not to exceed one hundred forty cars per
section. Sections shall be separated by landscaped buffers to provide visual relief. At a
minimum, the buffers shall consist of islands which shall be a combination of “divider
islands” and “terminal islands”.
b) Each landscaped island shall have a minimum area of one hundred fifty square feet and
shall consist of pervious landscaping. Landscaped islands may be curbed or without
curbing as follows: Curbing, at least five inches in height, shall surround each landscaped
island as protection from vehicles. No tree shall be planted less than four feet from the
curbing. Rain gardens shall be designed to meet LID standards and other applicable
stormwater management Best Management Practices (BMP’s) and may be designed
without curbing where appropriate. 
1) Divider Islands: The following additional design standards shall apply to divider
islands: 
(a) At least one landscaped divider island shall be provided for every four parallel
rows of parking. 
(b) Trees shall be spaced not more than twenty-seven feet on center. 
(c) At least one shrub shall be provided for every five linear feet, or one shrub per
thirty-five square feet of ground area, whichever results in a greater number of
shrubs. 
2) Terminal Islands: The following additional design standards apply to terminal
islands: 
(a) Terminal islands shall be used either (1) to separate parking spaces from
driveways and other vehicular
travel lanes, or (2) to break up large numbers of parking spaces in a single row
of spaces. 
(b) Landscaped terminal islands shall be provided at the ends of rows of parking
where such rows are adjacent to driveways or vehicular travel lanes. In addition, 
terminal islands shall separate groups of parking spaces in a row, such that no
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 90 
Page 94
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
continuous line of adjoining spaces contains more than twenty-five parking
spaces. 
(c) As an alternative to separating groups of parking spaces with small internal
terminal-islands, additional landscaped area may be provided. Such additional
landscaped area shall be provided as additional depth in the buffer strip (above
the minimum depth otherwise required in Section III.E.8.b. above), terminal and
divider islands adjacent to rows exceeding twenty-five spaces, and shall be
provided at a ratio of at least 1.2:1.0. However, no more than thirty-five
adjoining parking spaces may be provided in a row of spaces, regardless of the
size of the landscaped islands at the ends of the row. 
(d) Terminal islands shall contain at least two trees when abutting a double row of
parking spaces. 
(e) Landscaped terminal islands shall contain evergreen shrubs planted three feet or
less on center, in order to prevent damage due to pedestrian traffic. 
(f) Grass or ground cover may be substituted for shrubs in divider islands and
terminal islands with the approval of the Planning Board. 
2) Increase of impervious areas: Notwithstanding the limitation on paved areas set forth
elsewhere in Section III.E.8.h.1)b), a landscaped island may be up to thirty-three per cent
(33%) impervious surface, provided that all such area is used for pedestrian walkways and
that such walkways are adequately buffered from the parking areas. 
3) Use of porous paving materials: In order to minimize the amount of storm water runoff from
paved areas, the use of porous paving materials is encouraged where feasible. 
i.  Landscaping Adjacent to Buildings
Landscaped areas at least ten feet in depth shall be provided adjacent to buildings on every side of
such buildings that has a public access point and shall contain trees and shrubs. This requirement
may be waived by the Planning Board in cases where it is impractical to provide the specified
depth of landscaped area due to the size, shape or other characteristics of the parcel; however, in
no case shall any parking space or vehicular travel lane be located less than five feet from the
building. 
j. Standards for Plant Materials
1) All trees, shrubs and hedges must be species that are hardy in Plant Hardiness Zone 5, as
defined by the American Standards for Nursery Stock and shall be resistant to salt spray and
urban conditions where appropriate. 
2) Plantings shall be selected and designed so as not to require high water use for maintenance. 
3) Deciduous trees must be at least two and one-half to three inches caliper, six inches above
the top of the root ball, at the time of planting; and must be expected to reach a height of at
least twenty feet within ten years, when considering the expected normal growth patterns of
the species. 
4) Evergreen trees must be at least eight feet in height at the time of planting. 
5) Ornamental or specimen trees must be at least eight feet in height at the time of planting. 
6) Shrubs and hedges must be at least three and one-half feet in height or have a spread of at
least twenty-four inches at the time of planting. 
7) Shade or canopy trees shall be provided within parking lots, and within buffer strips. 
k. Design for Pedestrian Circulation
1) Pedestrian Access Through Buffers and Screens 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION III. PAGE 91 
Page 95
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION III. OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
Landscaped buffers should, to the greatest extent possible, serve as usable open space, 
providing an environment for pedestrian access between uses. Therefore, buffers shall be
designed to include appropriate means of pedestrian access and crossing, both along the
landscaped area (i.e., in a parallel direction with the property line) and across the buffer (i.e.,
providing pedestrian access to the site, separate from vehicular access points). Buffers and
screens shall provide for appropriate hard-surfaced pedestrian access points and walkways
where property lines abut existing or planned public streets, whether or not such streets have
been constructed. 
2) Pedestrian Circulation in Parking Facilities 
a) Parking facilities and appurtenant driveways shall be designed so as to gather pedestrians
out of vehicle travel lanes and to maximize the safety and convenience of pedestrians
walking between parked cars and business entrances as well as between external points
and locations on site. 
b) Pedestrian walkways shall be (i) integrated, to the extent possible, into the interior and/or
perimeter landscaping of parking lots; (ii) constructed with a paved or similarly firm
surface, at least six feet in width; and (iii) separated from vehicular and parking areas by
grade, curbing and/or vegetation, except for necessary ramps. 
l.  Maintenance
1) The owner(s) and/or developer(s) of any lot shall be responsible for the maintenance of all
landscaped open space and buffers. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition so as
to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and
debris. 
2) A permanent water supply system, sufficient in the Planning Board’s determination, shall be
provided by the installation of a sprinkler system and/or hose bibs placed at appropriate
locations. Whenever possible, “gray” or re-used water, or wells, shall be used as the water
source. 
3) Maintenance bond: The Planning Board may require a bond to ensure that required
landscape plantings are maintained and survive for up to one growing season following
completion of planting. 
m. Pervious Landscaping
Up to five per cent of the area counted as pervious landscaping may include pedestrian circulation
components such as walkways. Parking areas surfaced with porous pavement shall not be
considered pervious landscaping. 
9. Bonus Density Provisions
a. Eligibility for Bonus Floor Area
If a proposed improvement or facility in the Regional Center district complies with the standards
set forth in Section III.E.5.b. above, it shall be eligible for bonus floor area in accordance with the
requirements set forth in paragraphs b through f of this Section 9. 
b. Public Benefit Amenity
To qualify for bonus floor area a public benefit amenity must be specifically listed in the
Schedule of Benefits below. A public benefit amenity that is a physical space shall be one to
which the public is assured access on a regular basis, or an area that is dedicated to and accepted
by the City for public access purposes. Furthermore, to be considered a public benefit amenity, a
specific improvement or facility must be determined to provide a public benefit and to be
appropriate to the goals and character of the area. In addition, the following requirements must be
met: 
1) Parks
To be eligible as a public benefit amenity a park must meet all of the following standards:

•  have a minimum width of 50 feet; 
•  be buffered and/or screened from nearby roads, parking areas and other vehicular
circulation facilities; and
•  not be located within the landscape buffer strip required under Section III.E.8.f. 
For purposes of computing bonus credits, no more than one-third of the area of the park shall
consist of wetlands, water bodies, steep slopes (over 25%), or other areas not usable for
public recreation or leisure activities. On-site park area which meets the above standards and
which is not wetlands may be used to satisfy the minimum landscape surface ratio (LSR) 
requirement. On- or off-site park area may be used to qualify the project for bonus floor area. 
2) Pedestrian Circulation Improvement
Such improvements shall be directly accessible to the pedestrian circulation system, and shall
where possible connect with existing pedestrian circulation improvements on adjacent parcels
and/or provide for connection to such improvements which can reasonably be expected to be
developed on adjacent parcels. The following standards shall also be applicable: 
a) Pathway (Off-Site) 
A pathway shall be at least fifty feet from a vehicular circulation improvement for at least
ninety per cent of its length. 
b) Sidewalk (Off-Site) 
A sidewalk shall not be on land owned by the applicant or on public or private right-of-
way immediately adjacent to frontage of land owned by the applicant. 
c) Pedestrian Bridge/Tunnel
Bridges or tunnels should have clear functional relationships to adjoining commercial
properties and/or public open space amenities. To be eligible as a public benefit amenity, 
a pedestrian bridge or tunnel shall not be located entirely on the applicant's property, nor
shall it connect a principal use with an accessory use such as a parking structure. 
3) Service Roads
Driveways and other facilities which principally serve the internal circulation needs of a
project, and which provide only a marginal public benefit, shall not qualify as service roads
under the provisions of this Section III.E.9. 
c. Schedule of Bonuses
Bonus floor area shall be available in accordance with the bonus ratios listed in the following
“Schedule of Bonuses”, up to the maximum FAR permitted in this Section 9 if the Planning
Board deems that the amenity offered by the applicant accomplishes the objectives of this Section
III.E. The bonus ratio is the ratio of (1) the unit of public benefit amenity provided to (2) the floor
area permitted for bonus projects in excess of a FAR of 0.32. For example, a bonus ratio of one to
three (1:3) and an amenity unit of “Square Foot” means that for each square foot of the amenity
the project shall be eligible for three additional square feet of floor area for permitted uses.

d. State-Mandated Amenities
The Planning Board may grant bonus floor area for a public benefit amenity that is not
specifically listed in paragraph b above, only when the cost of such amenity exceeds 3% of the
total cost of the project and if: 
1) the provision of such amenity has been mandated as part of a State approval process; and, 
2) the provision of the alternative improvement furthers the objectives of this Section 9; and, 
3) the improvement is at least equivalent in value and effect to a listed public benefit amenity
which would qualify the development for the proposed amount of bonus floor area. 
e. Prospective Bonus Agreements
A project in the RC district, which proposes to provide a public benefit amenity but not to use the
full FAR increase which the amenity makes possible, may enter into a prospective bonus
agreement (PBA) with the Planning Board as a condition of the Planning Board's granting of a
Special Permit and/or Site Plan Approval. The PBA shall define the specific nature of the public
benefit amenity and the amount of FAR and additional floor area for which the parcel shall
become eligible as a result of provision of the improvement. The maximum term of a PBA shall
not exceed five years, following which the rights to any unused FAR increase shall become null
and void. If, for any reason, a change of use of a parcel that has been approved for an FAR
increase which is in whole or in part unused is proposed within the affective term of a PBA, the
owner must obtain the approval of the Planning Board to take advantage of such remaining
increase.
The only effect of a PBA shall be to increase the allowable FAR of the development, subject to
all other requirements of this Section III.E.9. The approval of a PBA by the Planning Board shall
not be deemed to supersede or waive any of the other provisions of this Section, nor shall such
approval be considered to represent the granting of site plan approval or special permit approval
for any future development. 
f. Continuing Obligation for Bonuses
1) Where a bonus is granted, the applicant shall covenant to ensure the continued use of the
bonus facility or improvement for the purpose for which the bonus was granted. Such
covenant shall be recorded as a condition of the special permit and shall run with the land. 
2) An applicant who constructs a pedestrian circulation improvement shall be responsible for
the maintenance, upkeep and provision of insurance for the improvement, unless it has been
dedicated to and accepted by the City. If the improvement is not maintained, the City may, at
its sole option, place a lien on the property, maintain the improvement, and seek
reimbursement from the owner. 
10. Administration
The review procedures set forth herein are intended to apply to the RC and HC districts, in addition to
the requirements of the underlying zoning district. In administering such procedures and
requirements, the Planning Board shall apply the standards of the underlying zoning district if such
standards, procedures and requirements are more restrictive than set forth in these Highway Overlay
District Regulations.

3. Lot Area Regulations
a. Lot Area Requirement
Where a minimum lot area is specified in Section IV.E.2., no principal building or use shall be
located on any lot of lesser area (such minimum lot area to be determined as set forth in these Lot
Area Regulations, Section IV.E.3.), except as may be permitted hereinafter; and no such area
shall include any portion of a street. 
b. Omitted
c. Irregularly-Shaped Lots
When the distance between any two points on lot lines is less than 50 feet, measured in a straight
line, the smaller portion of the lot which is bounded by such straight line and such lot lines shall
be excluded from the computation of the minimum lot area unless the distance along such lot
lines between such two points is less than 150 feet in such cases where the Minimum Lot Area is
less than 20,000 square feet, as set forth in the Table of Dimensional Regulations, Section IV.E.2. 
Otherwise, when the distance between any two points is less than 80 feet, measured in a straight
line, the smaller portion of the lot which is bounded by such straight line and such lot lines shall
be excluded from the computation of the minimum lot area, unless the distance along such lot
lines between such two points is less than 240 feet. In all cases, the principal use shall not be
located on such excluded area of the lot. 
d. Uplands Area Requirement
For the purpose of this Section, any lot laid out to be a buildable lot must contain upland area
totaling at least 100 percent of the minimum lot area requirement for the zoning district in which
the land is situated. In addition, a minimum of 70 percent of the required minimum lot area must
be contiguous upland area, and shall be the location for the principal structure on the lot. Portions
of a lot excluded from the computation of a minimum lot area, as provided under subsections
IV.E.3.c., above, shall not be used to meet the upland area requirements, herein. 
A lot for single or two family residential use, shall be exempt from this subsection d. Uplands
Area Requirement, provided such lot conformed to all zoning requirements at the time of
recording or endorsement. 
e. Moderate Slope Requirement 
Any lot laid out to be a buildable lot must contain 100 percent of the minimum lot area
requirement for the zoning district in which the land is situated, excluding areas that satisfy the
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION IV. PAGE 118 
Page 122
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION IV. DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS 
moderate slope requirement defined herein. In addition, a minimum of 70 percent of the required
minimum lot area must be contiguous, and shall be the location for the principal structure on the
lot. Portions of a lot excluded from the computation of a minimum lot area, as provided under
subsections IV.E.3.c.and d., above, shall not be used to meet the moderate slope requirement. 
A lot for single or two family residential use shall be exempt from this Section IV.E.3.e. 
Moderate Slope Requirement, provided such lot conformed to all zoning requirements at the time
of the recording or endorsement. 
The term “moderate slope” is defined and measured by the procedure as prescribed herein as all
areas of the entire lot prior to subdivision of the land into individual parcels with slopes natural
and unaltered greater than or equal to fifteen percent (15) over a horizontal distance of 100 feet, 
as measured perpendicular to the contour line as prescribed herein. For Lots lacking a horizontal
distance of 100 feet, the Slope will be calculated as an elevation change across a horizontal
distance of 50 feet as measured perpendicular to the contour line. Contours shall be at 2 foot
intervals based on the most recent National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). Plans shall note
the collection source of the contour data. Final slope shall be reviewed and confirmed by the City
Engineer and/or by a Peer Review Consultant. 
4. Lot Frontage and Width Regulations
a. Lot Frontage Requirement
Where a minimum lot frontage is specified in Section IV.E.2., no principal building or use shall
be located on a lot which fronts a lesser distance on a street. No principal building or use shall be
constructed or located on a lot unless adequate vehicular access exists or can be constructed to the
buildable portion of the lot, proposed structure or use from the street providing the minimum lot
frontage required by Section IV.E.2. Vehicular access shall be provided from the lot frontage to
the principal building or use, provided that the Planning Board by special permit may allow an
alternative vehicular access to the lot. Frontage shall provide both rights of access and potential
vehicular access across that lot line to a potential building site. Frontage shall be measured in a
single contiguous, uninterrupted line along a street or streets. A lawful pre-existing lot for single
or two family residential use that pre-dates the enactment of this section, shall be exempt from
this lot access requirement, provided such lot conformed to all zoning requirements at the time of
recording or endorsement. 
b. Lot Width Requirement
Each lot shall have a width such that the center of a circle having a minimum diameter of 80% of
the required frontage of the lot can be passed along a continuous line from the sideline of the
street along which the frontage of the lot is measured to any point of the building or proposed
building on the lot without the circumference intersecting any side lot line. 
In addition, each lot shall have a width such that the entire portion of the parcel from the lot
frontage to the required front setback line shall have a minimum width equal to the required lot
frontage as specified in Section IV.E.2., and such that the portion of the lot where any line passes
through a principal building on the lot shall also have a minimum width equal to the required lot
frontage as specified in Section IV.E.2. 
5. Setback Regulations
a. Front and Side Setback Requirements
Where a minimum depth of setback is specified in Section IV.E.2., no building or structure shall
be erected within the specified distance from the applicable lot line, except as permitted
hereinafter. 
b. Projections into Setbacks
1. Uncovered steps and ramps, and walls and fences no greater than six feet in height above the
natural grade, may be permitted in a setback. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION IV. PAGE 119 
Page 123
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION IV. DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS 
2. A portico over a front or a side doorway, or both, including a pediment, triangular-shaped or
otherwise, supporting columns and decorative pilasters, over a landing or an entrance area, 
open or enclosed; the entrance area not being more than fifty square feet in area, may be
permitted in a setback. Excluded from this exception are porticos in excess of one-story
height. 
c. Corner Clearance
In any district where a front setback is required, no building, fence or other structure may be
erected and no vegetation may be maintained between a plane two and one-half feet above curb
level and a plane seven feet above curb level within that part of the lot bounded by the sidelines
of intersecting streets and a straight line joining points on such sidelines 25 feet distant from the
point of intersection of such sidelines or extensions thereof. 
d. Side Setback Abutting Residential District
Where a side lot line of a lot in a non-residential district, abuts a Single Residence or General
Residence Zoning District, there shall be a minimum side setback requirement for buildings on
such lot of 30 feet; except in the Neighborhood Business (B-1) Districts, where such minimum
side setback requirement for buildings on such lot shall be 10 feet. This setback regulation for
such lot in a non-residential district shall not be applicable if such lot is for a single family or two
family residential use, in which case the setbacks in the Table of Dimensional Regulations shall
apply. 
e. Determination of Lot Lines
Where the designation of a front or side lot line for the purpose of determining required yards is
unclear because of the particular shape or type of lot, the Building Commissioner shall designate
the appropriate front or side lot line. 
f. Exception for Existing Alignment
In Single Residence, General Residence and Office and Professional Districts, if the alignment of
existing principal buildings on adjacent lots on each side of a lot fronting the same street in the
same district is nearer to the street line than the required front setback, the average of the existing
alignments of all such buildings within 200 feet of said lot shall be the required front setback. 
g. Limited Accessory Structures 
1. Limited accessory structures may be placed within the minimum side setback, provided that
the structures meet the criteria of this section. 
2. Dimensional Regulations for Limited Accessory Structures 
A limited accessory structure: 
a. Shall be no larger than 120 square feet of gross floor area, 
b. Shall not be more than twelve feet in height as measured from the average natural grade
at a distance of up to three feet from the structure, 
c. Shall not be located within the required front setback or any closer to that setback than
the primary structure. 
d. The accessory structure may be located at a distance from the lot line not less than one-
half of the required minimum side setback. 
3. No more than two limited accessory structures shall be permitted within the required side
setbacks on any one lot. 
h. Indoor Amusement Facility: Noisy activities shall be at least 100 feet away from any lot line
and effectively sound-insulated or screened to protect the neighborhood. 
i.  Outdoor Entertainment Facility: Noisy activities shall be at least 100 feet away from any
residential lot line and effectively screened from abutters to protect the neighborhood. 
j. Veterinary Services: Noisy activity shall be at least 100 feet from any residential lot line and
effectively sound-insulated or screened to protect the neighborhood.

 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION IV. DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS 
6. Open Space Regulations
a. Open Space Requirement
Where a minimum percentage of open space is specified in Section IV.E.2., no building or use
shall be located or substantially altered on any lot in which such space is not provided. 
b. Open Space in Front Setback
In any district where a front setback is required, landscaped open space ten feet in depth shall be
provided along the entire width of the lot at the front lot line. Said strip may be interrupted by
necessary vehicular and walkway entrances and exits. 
c. Usable Open Space for One-family and Two-family Dwellings
All one-family and two-family detached dwellings shall have a minimum of 800 square feet of
usable open space per bedroom. 
d. Open Space in Setback Abutting Residential District or Uses
In any district where a non-residential use abuts or faces a residential zoning district or a single
family or two family use, a landscaped open space buffer at a minimum depth of fifteen feet, shall
be provided and maintained in order to separate, both physically and visually, the residential use
from the non-residential use; except in the Neighborhood Business (B-1) Districts where such
minimum open space depth shall be five feet. The landscaped open space buffer strip shall be
continuous except for required vehicular access and pedestrian circulation. 
The buffer strip shall include a combination of deciduous and/or evergreen trees and lower-level
elements such as shrubs, hedges, grass, ground cover, fences, planted berms, and brick or stone
walls. Such open space buffer strips shall provide a strong visual barrier between uses at
pedestrian level and shall create a strong impression of spatial separation. 
e. Landscaping Requirement
In every district and for all uses and structures, which are subject to site plan review, landscaping
shall be provided in accordance with the purpose, intent, objectives and standards of Section
III.E.8. of these Zoning Ordinances, as feasible. All off-street parking plans and site plans, 
required under Sections IV.B. or VI.F. shall include a landscape plan and planting schedule
prepared by a registered landscape architect. Landscaped buffer strips along street right of ways
shall be in accordance with this Section IV.E.6. Open Space Regulations, except in Districts
where a larger buffer is required. Site constraints shall be considered in applying the standards of
Section III.E.8, which may be waived in accordance with Section III.E.10.c. 
7. Building Height, Bulk, and Utilities and Mechanical Equipment Screening Regulations
a. Maximum Height Requirement
Where a maximum height of buildings is specified in Section IV.E.2., no building or part of a
building shall exceed the specified number of stories and furthermore, no building or part of a
building shall exceed the specified feet above average finished grade, except as permitted
hereinafter. 
b. Exceptions to Maximum Height Requirement
1. The maximum height requirement specified in Section IV.E.2. shall not apply to accessory
structures or appurtenances normally built above the roof level and necessary for the
operation of the building or use, except in the Single Residence Districts R-1, R-2, R-3, and
R-4, and General Residence Districts. Such structures shall not be intended for human

IV.B. Special Provisions for parking relief, as provided under Section IV.B.9., may be
considered, including exemptions from required number of parking spaces and proximity
requirements, as applicable, but the requirement for number of parking spaces assigned to
residential uses may not be reduced below 1.25 parking spaces per residential unit. The applicant
shall demonstrate that the parking to be provided shall be adequate for the uses proposed. 
Conditions for approval of a special permit under Section IV.B.9, for a reduction to the required
number of parking spaces, may include, at the discretion of the Planning Board, a contribution to
a municipal parking program and/or support for public transportation or other transportation
demand management programs. Such contribution shall be directly related to the reduction
requested, and shall not exceed 2 percent of the development costs attributed to the residential
portion of the proposed development. Such contribution shall be credited to the development
under a Site Plan Review approval. 
c. Open Space and Recreation Enhancement
A minimum of 200 square feet of usable on-site outdoor open space or dedicated and usable
common indoor recreation space for use by unit residents shall be provided for each dwelling unit
proposed within a Mixed Use development project. An applicant contribution to a program of
off-site public improvements in the area of the proposed development, as set forth below, may be
considered by the SPGA in partial satisfaction of this requirement. An applicant may contribute
up to 1.5 percent of the development costs attributed to the residential portion of the proposed
development to a program of off-site public open space, pedestrian improvements, public
amenities, or community and cultural enhancements, in order to enhance the quality of life for
residents of the proposed development and the general public. Such contribution for off-site
improvements shall be at the discretion of the Planning Board and shall be credited to the
development under a Site Plan Review approval.

 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
d. Residential Composition
Residential composition in a proposed Mixed Use development shall be comprised of studios, 
one-bedroom units and two-bedroom units only. In no case may other rooms in a unit be
converted to additional bedrooms. Dwelling units within a Mixed Use development may measure
no less than 600 square feet. No more than twenty percent (20%) of the units in a Mixed Use
development proposal may consist of studio units. No more than three individuals unrelated by
birth, marriage or adoption may occupy a dwelling unit in a Mixed Use development. The
Planning Board may require a stipulation of said limit on unrelated individuals be included within
all leases, condominium documents, protective covenants and other related documents. 
e. Separation between Residential Uses and Non-Residential Uses
Residential uses and non-residential uses in a Mixed-Use development shall be physically
separated. Residential uses shall have separate and distinct entrances from non-residential uses. 
f. Community Impact
(a) Purpose: To evaluate the impacts of the proposed development with respect to the City's
visual and historic character and development goals. 
(b) Format and Scope: 
(i) Site design and neighborhood impact: evaluation of the relationship of proposed new
structures or alterations to nearby pre-existing structures in terms of character and
intensity of use (e.g., scale, materials, color, door and window size and locations, 
setbacks, roof and cornice lines, and other major design elements); and of the location
and configuration of proposed structures, parking areas, and open space with respect to
neighboring properties. 
(ii) Historic impact: identification of impacts on significant historic properties, districts or
areas, or archaeological resources (if any) in the vicinity of the proposed development. 
(iii) Development goals: evaluation of the proposed project's consistency or compatibility
with existing local and regional plans. 
4. Building Permit Limitations 
a. Following special permit for use, Site Plan Review and other regulatory processes, and in
accordance with an SPGA Decision, the Building Commissioner may issue building permits for
Mixed Use development for a maximum of 300 residential units for Mixed Use development per
calendar year (with no rollover from a previous year).  Of these 300 permitted residential units
per year, no more than 250 residential units may be permitted for a specific development
application in a given year. The Building Commissioner may not issue building permits for
additional residential units in Mixed Use development once the number of such units for which
building permits have previously been issued reaches three percent (3%) of the total number of
dwelling units in the Framingham. Any changes to the Building Permit Limitations, as set forth
herein, shall require approval by the City Council. 
b. Purpose 
The purpose of the limitation (or cap) on the number of dwelling units permitted in a Mixed Use
development is to promote orderly growth in a planned manner so that it will not unduly strain
the community's ability to provide basic public facilities and services for an expanded residential
population. 
c. Applicability
This section shall apply to the issuance of all building permits for construction of dwelling units
located in a Mixed Use development for which a special permit decision of the Planning Board
approving such development was filed with the City Clerk on or after the time of the adoption of
this Mixed-use Regulation Ordinance. 
d. Administration
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION V. PAGE 144 
Page 148
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
Building permits for new dwellings will be available starting on January 1 of each calendar year. 
Permits will be issued on a first-come, first-served basis. An applicant will not be issued a
building permit for more units than has been specified in a Special Permit for Mixed Use by the
Planning Board. Mixed Use development projects may be phased in over more than one year. 
Applications for Mixed Use development shall be denied by the Building Commissioner when
the limitation on number of dwelling units has been reached for a particular calendar year. Upon
denial, an applicant may file a written request to the Building Commissioner to have the
application automatically resubmitted to the Building Commissioner on January 1 of the
subsequent calendar year or an earlier date, should a permit for a sufficient number of residential
units under Mixed Use development become available sooner. The effective date of the
application shall be the date the application is accepted for resubmission, not the original
application date, and the applicant shall be subject to the State Building Code effective as of the
date of building permit issuance. 
Denied applications shall be taken up by the Building Commissioner in the order in which the
written request for automatic resubmission has been received by the Building Commissioner, 
taking into account the availability of building permits for the number of residential units
requested. Resubmitted applications must be complete and Special Permits must not have lapsed. 
Should any building permits issued for an approved Mixed Use development for a given calendar
year be withdrawn or lapse within the same calendar year, other applicants with a written request
for automatic resubmission shall be taken up by the Building Commissioner as set forth above. 
Such permits may be issued in the same calendar year provided that the building permit
limitations of this Section are not exceeded for that calendar year. 
5. Planning Board Mixed Use Development Waivers by Special Permit
The Planning Board may, by special permit, grant waivers to the Mixed Use Development Standards, 
as set forth under Section V.G.3. herein, and the Dimensional Regulations for Mixed Use
development, as set forth under Section IV.E.2. herein, for Mixed-Use development. Such Special
Permit for Mixed Use Development Waivers shall be granted only if the Planning Board makes the
specific required findings, in writing, as set forth under Section VI.E.3., as well as the following
finding. The Planning Board must also find that the proposed project with the waived requirement
shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the project without the waiver. 
As a basis for its decision, the Planning Board shall consider factors which shall include, but not be
limited to, the impact of the waiver on traffic and parking; municipal services and facilities; and the
character of the neighborhood including environmental and visual features.

The provisions of this Inclusionary Housing Ordinance shall apply to any proposed development or
redevelopment of ten or more dwelling units on one or more contiguous parcels, whether such units
are proposed under a special permit process pursuant to M.G.L. c. 40A, Section 9. The following
provisions shall be required for all Inclusionary Housing projects. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION V. PAGE 146 
Page 150
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
a. In any development subject to this Section V.H, at least 10 percent of the dwelling units shall be
Affordable Housing Units (AHU).  Fractional interests shall be rounded up to the next whole
number. Nothing shall preclude an applicant from providing more AHUs than the number
required herein. 
b. Each AHU created under this Section V.H shall be sold or rented to a Qualified Income-Eligible
Household, except that when the applicant provides at least one-half of the required affordable
units for households with income at or below 50 percent of AMI, adjusted for income, the
remaining affordable units may be sold or rented to households with incomes up to 100 percent of
AMI, adjusted for household size, if approved by the SPGA.

affirmative fair housing marketing plan under Subsection 7 below has been approved by DHCD. 
4. Exemptions
i.  Section V.H. shall not apply to the rehabilitation of any building or structure wholly or
substantially destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty, provided that such rehabilitation
or repair shall increase the number of dwelling units on the lot as existed prior to the damage
or destruction thereof, except in conformance with the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. 
ii.  Active Adult Housing projects providing housing for adult residents age 55 and older approved by the
Planning Board under the former Active Adult Housing Ordinance (Section V.I) prior to the first
publication of notice of this amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and filed with the Town or City
Clerk, shall comply with the conditions of the granted decision for the respective project for
Inclusionary Housing. 
5.  Application Procedures, Submission Requirements, and Mandatory Provision of Affordable
Units
Application, review, and decision procedures shall be in accordance with residential or residential
mixed-use development regulations Sections VI.E. and/or F. of these Zoning Ordinances, and/or the
Rules & Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Framingham, as amended. The Planning
Board shall require that the applicant comply with the obligation to provide affordable housing
pursuant to the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance as provided below as a condition of approval of any
residential development and/or redevelopment. 
a. Siting: AHUs shall be dispersed and sited throughout a development so as not to be in less
desirable locations than the development’s market-rate units. 
b. Design and Construction: AHUs shall be comparable to and indistinguishable from market-rate
units in exterior building materials and finishes, windows, and other improvements related to the
energy efficiency of the units. 
c. Rights and Privileges: Owners and tenants of AHUs and market-rate units shall have equal rights
and privileges to access and use of the development’s amenities and facilities. 
d. Units to be Rented or Sold: The Applicant shall provide one AHU for each ten dwelling units to
be created. Fractions shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
e. Phasing: Affordable units shall not be the last units to be built in any development and/or
redevelopment covered by this Section V.H. 
f. Non-Avoidance by Phasing or Segmentation: A development shall not be phased or segmented in
a manner to avoid compliance with this Ordinance. The Planning Board shall not approve any
application for development or redevelopment that results in ten or more new dwelling units if the
land or parcels of land were held in common ownership (including ownership by related or jointly
controlled persons or entities) and were subdivided or otherwise modified to avoid compliance. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION V. PAGE 147 
Page 151
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
Dwelling units shall be considered as part of a single development if located either on a single
parcel or contiguous parcels of land that have been in the same common ownership at any time
subsequent to the date of adoption of this Section V.H. The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance shall
be enforceable also against purchasers of land previously held in common ownership with land
that received, after the date of adoption of this Section V.H, approvals or permits for
development, to the effect that units developed under such previous development shall be counted
toward the calculation of number of units under Sections V.H.4.a. and V.H.4.b. herein. 
6.  Density Bonus
a. A Special Permit may be granted for applicants who seek a density bonus for the inclusion of
AHU within a residential project. The Planning Board shall be the SPGA for Section V.H.6. 
herein. One AHU shall be provided for every four market-rate units. The applicant shall be
subject to all of the requirements of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, unless modified
within Section V.H.6. 
b. A density bonus pursuant to Section V.H.6. may be permitted for residential projects with a
minimum of four residential building lots that are allowed by-right. 
c. Projects that provide four market rate units and one AHU may reduce the lot size by twenty
percent for each of the five lots. All other Dimensional Regulations in Section IV.E.2. shall
be met for each lot. 
d. Additional lots in a project that do not meet the requirements of four market rate units and
one AHU shall not be eligible for a decrease in lot area. Therefore, if a project provides
seven lots, only five of the lots shall be eligible for the 20 percent lot area decrease. However, 
ten lots providing eight market rate units and two AHU shall be eligible for the 20 percent lot
area decrease. 
7. Affordable Housing Regulations
a. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 40A, Section 9, the Planning Board shall adopt and maintain a set of
Affordable Housing Regulations that contain the necessary policies, procedures, and requirements
to implement the provisions of this Section V.H. 
8. Restrictions
a. Restrictive documents: To ensure unit affordability, AHUs shall be rented or sold subject to
applicable AHR, acceptable to the City and established in accordance with the standards of the
DHCD, or its successor entity, or such additional programs as may be adopted by the
Commonwealth or its agencies, restricting the use and occupancy, rent level, and sales price of
such AHUs. 
b. Term of Affordable Housing Restriction: An AHU shall ensure that AHUs created under this
section shall remain affordable in perpetuity or for the longest period of time allowed by law. All
restrictive documents shall be enforceable and renewable by the City pursuant to applicable law. 
c. DHCD SHI: An AHU shall be restricted in its initial and any subsequent sale, lease, and/or rental
to a Qualified Income-Eligible Household at a specific price limit that will qualify such
residential unit for inclusion in the DHCD SHI. 
d. Selection of Eligible Tenants and Homeowners: There shall be a fair and reasonable procedure in
compliance with fair housing laws for the selection of tenants for affordable rental units and for
the selection of homeowners for affordable homeownership units. The City may contract with a
quasi-public, public, and/or private entity, experienced in affordable housing operation, for
provision of tenant and homeowner selection services but shall be required to monitor the
performance of any private entity providing such services and shall retain final responsibility for
ensuring compliance. 
e. Income and Asset Limits: Qualified Income-Eligible Household income of prospective
purchasers and renters shall not exceed 80 percent of area median income based on household
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION V. PAGE 148 
Page 152
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
size as determined by HUD. Qualified Purchaser or Qualified Renter shall also be required to
demonstrate that total household assets, other than income are not so high that a household has no
substantial need of a rental unit with a reduced rent or of an ownership unit with a reduced
purchase price. 
f. Occupancy: The AHR for AHUs shall require, whether the unit initially is sold or rented, that the
occupant(s) of that unit must be a Qualified Income-Eligible Household as defined in this Section
V.H. This provision shall not prohibit a unit initially designated as owner-occupied from being
leased, so long as it is a lease qualifying under the provisions hereunder and the occupant(s) are a
Qualified Income-Eligible Household. 
9. Monitoring and Enforcement
a. The Planning Board shall maintain an inventory of the City’s AHU and shall prepare an annual
report, a copy of which shall be provided to DHCD, stating the following: 
i.  whether rental units are rented to low or moderate income households at rents not
exceeding the maximum rents set forth above, 
ii.  whether ownership units continue to be occupied as the domicile and principal residence
of the owner, and
iii. in the event of a resale, whether the unit has been resold to a low or moderate income
buyer for no more than the maximum permissible resale price and subject to a new or
continued AHR. 
b. Monitoring of Rental Units: AHUs shall be subject to an AHR that contains limitations on use, 
occupancy, resale and rents, and provides for periodic monitoring to verify compliance with and
enforce said restriction. 
c. Monitoring of AHUs: Upon conveyance or resale, affordable homeownership units shall be
monitored by the City, DHCD, or a qualified third party for compliance with the AHR’s resale
provisions. For all subsequent resales, it is the responsibility of the Monitoring Agent to establish
a sales price. 
d. Loss of Eligibility Status: Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit eviction of a
Qualified Purchaser or Qualified Tenant of an AHU due to loss of his/her eligibility status during
the time of ownership or term of lease or rental. 
e. Transfer of AHU: The restrictions governing an AHU shall be enforced upon resale, re-rental, 
and/or renewal of lease of the AHU. For owner-occupied units, the use restriction shall ensure
that units may only be resold to Qualified Income-Eligible Household who are Qualified
Purchasers or Qualified Renters consistent with the then applicable income limits established by
HUD, or successor, and/or the DHCD, or successor. 
f. All Restrictions Remain in Effect: Nothing in the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance shall be
construed to permit any Deed Rider, covenant, agreement, and/or other mechanism restricting
such items as the use and occupancy, rent level, and resale price of AHUs, and the enforcement
thereof to expire prior to any maximum limitations set forth by applicable state law. It is intended
that the restrictions required herein shall survive, to the limit allowed by law, including, but not
limited to, bankruptcy and foreclosure. 
g. Timing of commitments: All contractual agreements required hereunder and any documents
necessary to ensure compliance with this section shall be approved as to content by the Planning
Board and City Counsel prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit for newly constructed, 
redeveloped, rehabilitated, and/or rental units. 
h. Approval of Form and Content of Legal Documents: The applicant shall be responsible for
preparing any documentation required by DHCD in order to secure LIP approval of the AHU and
ensure their eligibility for the DHCD SHI. Furthermore, the applicants shall prepare all AHR
and/or legal instruments required to comply with Section V.H. herein, and such documents shall
be in a form satisfactory to the City Solicitor, The applicant shall reimburse the City for
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION V. PAGE 149 
Page 153
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
reasonable legal expenses incurred by the City Solicitor in reviewing or revising said deed and
legal instruments. 
i.  Recording of Restrictions: The special permit decision, if applicable, and all restrictive covenants
required under said special permit or this Section V.H. shall be recorded at the Registry of Deeds
or filed with the Registry District of the Land Court, as applicable, prior to the endorsement of
any subdivision plan for the development and before the issuance of any building permit for the
development. 
j.  Content of Restrictions: Where the Planning Board endorses a subdivision of land that contains
tracts of land not divided into building lots, but which land could later trigger the provisions of
Section V.H.4.e. herein, the covenant for such subdivision shall note the potential for the
provisions of Section V.H.4.e. to apply to a later development. 
I. ADULT HOUSING 
1. Purpose and Intent 
The Adult Housing (AH) Ordinance is intended to provide unique living opportunities for adult residents over the
age of 62 years. The AH Ordinance is intended to develop parcels of land in such a way so as to preserve tracts of
land while providing a variety of housing options and services to residents of the development. An AH
development should strive to provide an integrated “live and play” type of environment through the inclusion of
recreational space and trails, and medical and personal service space, while providing walkable connections and
access to nearby neighborhoods, retail amenities, educational experiences, social events, and aging in place
options. 
The intent of AH is to encourage appropriate development that blends with surrounding land uses and
neighborhoods, preserves large tracts of land, and creates a neighborhood environment that includes amenities
for its users. The AH Ordinance is a land use application consistent with the goals and objectives of the
Framingham Master Land Use Plan and Open Space & Recreation Plan. 
2. Definitions
Definitions associated with Section V.I. of these Ordinances can be found in Section I.E. Definitions of these
Ordinances. Such definitions include Adult Housing, Affordable Housing Units (AHU), Dwelling, Exclusive
Use Area (EUA), Parcel, Preservation Area, Townhouse, Two-family Dwelling, and Workforce Housing. 
3. Land and Development Requirements
a. Land Requirements
To qualify for a special permit under the AH Ordinance, the Special Permit Granting Authority (SPGA) 
must find that the subject parcel satisfies all of the following conditions: 
i.  the parcel is located within a residential zoning district that includes the Single Family (R-1, R-2, R-3, 
R-4) or the General Residential (G) Zoning Districts; 
ii.  the parcel is serviced by public water and sewer over the legal frontage of the development parcel; 
iii. the parcel has not been subdivided into smaller parcels, including Approval Not Required (ANR) 
within a 5-year period prior to submission of an application for Section V.I, herein; and
iv. the parcel contains a minimum lot area per Zoning District as reflected in Table One below, titled
“Minimum Number of Buildable Acres”.

Page 154
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
b. Development Requirements
i.  Division and Use of Land 
Applicants shall utilize the following method to calculate the total number of residential units
permitted within an AH development and for setting aside the Preservation Area and amenity space. 
The basis for such determinations shall be a Preliminary Subdivision Plan prepared in accordance
with the Rules and Regulations Governing the Division of Land in Framingham (Subdivision Rules
and Regulations).
The following steps shall be followed to determine the number of units within an AH development. 
a) The Preliminary Subdivision Plan shall depict: 
i.  the surveyed boundaries; 
ii.  the delineation of wetlands and identification of the 30-foot and 50-foot wetland buffers
and the 125-foot vernal pool buffer; 
iii. the Preservation Area2, pursuant to Table Two: Division of Land, prior to the division of
land; 
iv. Lands under an Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) or Conservation Restriction
(CR) at the time of the surveying, delineation, and/or the submittal of an AH application
shall not be included in the Preservation Area; and 
v.  The remaining lands not delineated as wetlands, vernal pools and buffers, shown as the
Preservation Area, and placed under an APR, and/or CR may then be divided for the
determination of the total number of individual lots pursuant to the Subdivision Rules and
Regulations. Each individual lot shall have the appropriate amount of upland to be
deemed a buildable lot as set forth in Table Two: Division of Land. 
b) The Planning Board reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to impose more stringent standards
and/or to reduce the number of units to ensure that impacts generated by the project on: 
•  quality of the land and locations of wetlands, vernal pools, and all other resources and
buffer zones as indicated by review of the Conservation Commission; 
•  slopes defined as Moderate Slope; 
•  public water and sewer capacity; and
•  capacity and safety of associated roadways and infrastructure (extended stopping
distances, sight line distances, and other similar traffic and circulation issues, etc.)
are adequately addressed. 
c) One lot shall be reserved for amenity structures and/or areas. The amenity structures and areas
may exceed the size of one lot but shall not reduce the number of residential units other than for
the first lot as outlined within this sub-section. This lot on which amenity structures are situated
shall not be included in the determination of the number of residential units to be constructed. 
d) Applicants may place a maximum number of residential units per lot as outlined in Table Two: 
Division of Land, minus one lot for amenity purposes. 
e) Assuming feasibility when all other constraints are met, applicants may qualify for up to but not
more than a 50 percent density bonus (1.5 units per buildable lot) based on the preliminary
subdivision plan, and lot-size requirements determined for each zoning district. The Amenity
Structure will not count toward the total unit number calculation. The Planning Board reserves
the right to reduce the density bonus as described elsewhere due to other constraints such as
traffic, safety, resource protection, infrastructure, etc. 
f) For each additional unit above the allowed number of lot yielded by the preliminary subdivision
plan the developer shall provide an additional one percent of the property (minus the Preservation
Area) as open space and added to the Preservation Area. The required AHU and the Workforce
Housing Units shall not be counted nor require additional open space for the Preservation Area. If
2 The Preservation Area shall be removed from the parcel as outlined in Table Two: Division of Land, prior to the division of land

Page 155
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
the developer provides more than the minimum required AHU and/or Workforce Housing units
then these will require additional Preservation Area to be provided.

Parcel Front Setback shall be measured from the edge of the property inward prior to the
division of any land. No structures shall be located within the Parcel Front Setback, but the
SPGA may allow street trees, stonewalls, trails, sidewalks, and other nonstructural features
within the Parcel Front Setback. A maximum of two curb cuts may be established along one
roadway. 
b) The Parcel Side Setback shall contain no structures, roadways, or infrastructure. No
vegetation in this buffer may be disturbed, destroyed, or removed, except for normal
maintenance. The Parcel Side Setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the parcel inward

owner has failed to remedy it; alternatively, the Planning Board may continue the public hearing, 
or by a four-fifth vote extend the time period in which the violation may be corrected. 
K. NEIGHBORHOOD CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT 
1. Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the Neighborhood Cluster Development (NCD) Ordinance is to allow, by special
permit from the Planning Board, an alternative use and pattern of land development to the standard
conventional grid subdivision permitted in the single-family residential districts (R-1 and R-2). The
intent of the NCD Ordinance is to: 
a. further the goals and policies of the Master Land Use Plan; 
b. conform the development to existing topography and natural features better than a conventional
or grid subdivision; 
c. consume less open land; 
d. create a residential neighborhood that provides opportunities for social interaction, such as
walking and hiking in Common Land Areas; 
e. utilize the most recent version of the Massachusetts Highway Department: Project Development
and Design Guide-Complete Street Design Techniques; 
f. utilize Low Impact Development Design Techniques; 
g. utilize Green Building Design Techniques; and
h. facilitate the construction and maintenance of housing, streets, utilities, and public service in an
economical and efficient manner. 
2. Applicability 
a. Any parcel or parcels of land, that are in one ownership throughout or any combination of parcels
of land consolidated under a Purchase and Sale Agreement where all such owners jointly apply
for a NCD special permit. To be included in an application for a NCD Special Permit and defined
herein as the NCD tract, such parcel or parcels must have definite boundaries ascertainable from a
recorded deed or recorded plan and be located within a zone permitting a NCD. 
b. The Planning Board may permit lots directly on opposite sides of a street, right-of-way, or public
utility to qualify as a single NCD tract of land. To permit such division of an NCD tract of land
by a street, right-of-way, or public utility, the Planning Board must find that this would comply
with the purpose of this section and not result in any more dwelling units than would be possible
in accordance with the provisions of the NCD Ordinance if the lots on either side of the street, 
right-of-way, or public utility were developed separately. Such permit shall be subject to the
Dimensional Regulations and Design Standards under Section V.K.3. herein. 
c. Eligible properties shall be located in the Single-Family Residential Zoning Districts of R-1 or R-
2 and shall be served by municipal public water and sewer. The total gross land area included
within the NCD tract shall be at least 4 contiguous acres in size with a minimum of 40 feet of
frontage on a street. 
d. The Planning Board may issue a special permit under this Section, subject to the requirements of
the NCD Ordinance, and in accordance with the additional requirements and standards specified
within this Section V.K., only if no variance has been issued from the requirements of this
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION V. PAGE 161 
Page 165
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
Section V.K. A variance shall render a property ineligible for the filing of a NCD application and
special permit under this section. 
e. No substantial alteration to a parcel of land, which shall include tree removal, utility installations, 
ditching, grading or construction of roads, grading of land or lots, or excavation except for
purposes of soil testing, dredging or filling, or construction of buildings or structures shall be
done within 12 months prior to the filing of an NCD application. The above activities shall render
a property ineligible for the filing of a NCD application and special permit under this section. 
3. Neighborhood Cluster Development Standards
a. Permitted Uses: Permitted uses in the NCD shall be single-family detached dwellings and/or
townhouse dwellings with no more than 3 attached townhouse dwelling units. The Planning
Board by an affirmative vote of at least four members may allow 4 attached dwelling units. 
b. Density: The intensity of use for a NCD shall be determined through the use of the following
density formula herein and shall be calculated in the order presented in 1) through 5) below. 
NCD DENSITY FORMULA
1) Total Gross Land Area (T) – Infrastructure (I) - Wetlands (W) - Slope (S) = Net Buildable Area
(NBA) 
2) Net Buildable Area (NBA) / Minimum Lot Area (MLA) = Base Residential Density (BRD) 
3) Base Residential Density (BRD) * Minimum Open Space (ORU) = Common Land Area (C) 
4) Net Buildable Area (NBA) – Common Land Area (C) = Developable Area(DA) 
5) Developable Area (DA) / Minimum Lot Area (MLA) * Number of Bedrooms (TB) = Allowed Bedroom
Count (ABC) 
(T) = Total Gross Land Area (sq. ft.)
(I) = 12% of Total Gross Land Area for Infrastructure (sq. ft.)
(W) = 100% of Total Wetlands on Site (sq. ft.)
(S) = Total Slope greater than 20% on Site (sq. ft.). Slope shall be reviewed and confirmed by the
City Engineer or by the Planning Board’s professional consultant. 
(NBA) = Net Buildable Area (sq. ft.)
(MLA)= Minimum Lot Area for a single-family detached dwelling in the R-1 and R-2 Zoning

c. Dimensional Regulations: The dimensional regulations specified in Section IV.E. are not
applicable, except as specified herein. However, the Planning Board must find that such
exceptions from Section IV.E. will result in better design, improved protection of natural and
scenic resources, and will otherwise comply with these regulations. The Planning Board shall not

O. TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS 
1. Purpose 
The purpose of the Transfer of Development Right (TDR) Ordinance is to provide an alternative for
the preservation of Developable Farm and/or Developable Open Space Parcels; while encouraging
economic development through an increase in the development potential within designated parcels. 
Through a TDR special permit a Developable Farm and/or Developable Open Space Parcel can sell
its potential Development Rights to a Receiving Parcel; thereby allowing the Receiving Parcel to
meet its companies’ growth demands. The objective of the TDR is twofold: to serve as an economic 
development tool while promoting the preservation of Developable Farm and/or Developable Open
Space parcel in exchange. The intent of the TDR special permit is consistent with the goals and
objectives of the Framingham Master Land Use Plan and Open Space & Recreation Plan, as may be
amended from time to time. 
2. Applicability
a. The Giving Parcel
1. The Planning Board shall determine the allowable Development Rights that may be
transferred to a Receiving Parcel. To determine the total Development Rights allowed to be
transferred, the owner of the Giving Parcel shall prepare a Transfer of Development Rights
Yield Plan (TDR Yield Plan).
2. The owner of the Giving Parcel shall submit the TDR Yield Plan and an application to the
Planning Board for review. The Planning Board may retain a Peer Review Consultant at the
expense of the owner of the Giving Parcel to ensure the TDR Yield Plan represents a true and
accurate representation of the Giving Parcel. 
3. The TDR Yield Plan will be reviewed during a posted public hearing; notice of the public
hearing shall be made in accordance with G.L. c. 40A, §11. 
4. The total allowable Development Rights that the Giving Parcel is eligible to transfer shall be
the total square footage of the residential building allowed as denoted in the Transfer of
Development Rights Residential Building Size Chart within the specific zoning district that
the Giving Parcel is located in. The size of the residential building as denoted in the Transfer
of Development Rights Residential Building Size Chart shall be multiplied by the total
number of building lots allowed by-right to determine the total area to be transferred to a
Receiving Parcel and placed under an APR and/or CR. 
Transfer of Development Rights Residential Building Size Chart
Giving Parcel Zoning District Residential Building Size
Single Family Residential (R-4)  6,500 square feet
Single Family Residential (R-3)  6,000 square feet
Single Family Residential (R-2)  5,500 square feet
Single Family Residential (R-1)  5,000 square feet
General Residential (G)  4,500 square feet
5. The APR and/or CR placed on the Giving Parcel shall be as follows: 
•  For Giving Parcels transferring all Development Rights: At the expense of the owner
of the Giving Parcel, the entire Developable Farm and/or Developable Open Space
Parcel shall be placed under an APR and/or CR in perpetuity. The entire Giving
Parcel shall include all areas identified as non-buildable areas which include
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION V. PAGE 175 
Page 179
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION V. SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
wetlands, wetland buffers, and Moderate Slopes, in addition to the buildable lots as
identified in the TDR Yield Plan. 
•  For Giving Parcels transferring a portion of Development Rights: At the expense of
the owner of the Giving Parcel the portion of the Developable Farm and/or
Developable Open Space Parcel associated with the square footage to be transferred
shall be placed under an APR and/or CR. This shall include all building lot areas
associated with the residential building unit square footage, infrastructure and
roadways associated with the building lots, and all non-buildable areas including
wetlands, wetland buffers, and Moderate Slopes as identified in the TDR Yield Plan. 
For fractions of residential building unit square footage, all fractions shall be rounded
up to the nearest whole number. The portion of the land to be placed under an APR
and/or CR shall be selected with the intent of creating contiguous tracks of land and
where possible contiguous with abutting farm land and open space land. 
6. All lands deemed non-buildable on the Giving Parcel, such as wetlands, wetland buffers, 
and Moderate Slopes as identified in the TDR Yield Plan, shall be placed under an APR
and/or CR at the same time as the first Development Rights are placed under an APR
and/or CR. 
Development Rights on a Giving Parcel that have not been transferred to a Receiving
Parcel shall remain eligible for future transfer or development. 
b. The Receiving Parcel
1. The owner of the Receiving Parcel shall file an application for a TDR special permit with
the Planning Board. 
2. The owner of the Receiving Parcel shall enter into an agreement with the owner of the
Giving Parcel for the transfer of the Development Rights prior to applying for a TDR
special permit. 
3. The Planning Board Administrator shall ensure that the APR and/or CR has been placed
on the Giving Parcel by the Receiving Parcel prior to the issuance of any occupancy and
use permit. 
4. The owner of the Receiving Parcel may assemble Development Rights from multiple
Giving Parcels. The resulting development on a Receiving Parcel shall not exceed the
allowable dimensional requirement increases stated herein. Parcels of land that are pre-
existing non-conforming lots that exceed allowed densities or that have received
variances for building height, number of additional floors, lot coverage, and/or FAR are
not eligible to receive transferred Development Rights. 
5. The transferred Development Rights from the Giving Parcel may be used in a 1:1 ratio on
a Receiving Parcel. Development Rights from the Giving Parcel that are used on a
Receiving Parcel may be applied on the Receiving Parcel to increase the following
dimensional regulations from those stated in Section IV.E.2. Table of Dimensional
Regulations allowed by-right. Allowed increases as permitted in Section IV.E.2. should
not create the need for an increase in parking that exceeds the capacity of the Receiving
Parcel. If the increase as permitted in Section IV.E.2. requires more additional parking
than the site can support, then the Receiving Parcel shall construct structured parking or
establish alternative transportation options to the site such as carpool incentives, 
transportation from local public transportation hubs, etc.

Chapter 184 Section 32 to ensure that said parcel will remain as agricultural land or open
space. Once an APR and/or CR has been placed on the Giving Parcel no additional buildings
can be built on nor can any land be used to yield additional Development Rights in the future, 
except as per c.2., below; 
2. No buildings are allowed within the APR and/or CR area, except for existing buildings that
have been constructed prior to the TDR Yield Plan. Farms shall be allowed to construct
structures associated with the operations of the farm on up to 5 percent of the APR area. 
Structures associated with the farm may include: barns, farm store, housing for farm help, 
etc.;
3. The APR and/or CR may be held by the City of Framingham, a land trust, or the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The APR and/or CR is prohibited from being held by the
owner of the Giving Parcel or the owner of the Receiving Parcel. The terms of the APR
and/or CR shall be reviewed by City Solicitor at the expense of the owner of the Giving
Parcel and approved by the Planning Board;

4. Variance Limitation
The Planning Board may issue a TDR special permit in accordance with the additional
requirements and standards specified within Section V.O., only if the receiving parcel is not a
pre-existing non-conforming property and a variance has not ever been issued from the
requirements of this Section V.O for the Receiving Parcel. A pre-existing non-conformity or a
variance from the provisions of Section V.O. shall render a property ineligible for the filing of a
TDR special permit application and TDR special permit.

7. Decision
a. Specific Findings Required
Prior to granting approval or disapproval, the Planning Board shall make written findings with
supporting documentation as specified below. Such findings shall pertain to the entire proposed
development including any site plan or design modifications imposed by the Planning Board as a
condition of its approval, and any off-site improvements proposed by the applicant or required by
the Planning Board as a condition of its approval. 
b. Approval
The Planning Board shall approve an application, based on its review of the projected
development impacts and the proposed methods of mitigating such impacts, if said Planning
Board finds that the proposed development is in conformance with this Ordinance, after
considering whether the proposed development will comply, to the extent feasible, with the
standards set forth herein 
c. Disapproval
1) The Planning Board may reject a site plan that fails to furnish adequate information required
by this Ordinance; 
2) The Planning Board may reject a site plan where, although proper in form, the plan depicts a
use or structure so intrusive on the needs of the public in one regulated aspect or another that
rejection by the Planning Board would be tenable.

G. VARIANCES 
l.  Limitation of Use Variances
A variance authorizing a use or activity not otherwise permitted in the district in which the land is
located shall be prohibited in Geriatric Care/Elderly Housing Districts, Central Business (CB) Zoning
District, Nobscot Village District (B-4), single residence and general residence districts, but may be
allowed by the Board of Appeals in other zoning districts in accordance with G.L. c. 40A, §10 except
as otherwise prohibited in Section II.C of these Zoning Ordinances. 
A variance authorizing a Marijuana Retail Establishment outside of the Marijuana Retail Overlay
Zoning District shall not be permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Nor shall a variance for the
locating of a Marijuana Cultivator and Marijuana Product Manufacture outside of the identified areas
specified in Section II.B.6.C of these Ordinances. 
2. Procedure for Variance
a. Application
Prior to the filing of a petition for a variance, the Applicant shall submit a building permit
application and plans to the Building Commissioner who shall advise the applicant in writing as
to the sections of these Zoning Ordinances with which the application and plans are not in
compliance. The Applicant shall then file six copies of an appeal or petition for a variance with
the City Clerk, who shall forthwith transmit copies of the application and accompanying plans to
the ZBA, Planning Board, and Building Commissioner. The Planning Board may, within 2l days
of the date of filing with the City Clerk, submit a report to the ZBA containing recommendations
and reasons therefor to aid the ZBA in judging the application. The ZBA shall not hold a hearing
or render a decision on any appeal or petition for a variance until said report has been received
and considered or until the 2l-day period has expired, whichever is earlier. Failure of the Planning
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION VI. PAGE 197 
Page 201
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION VI. ADMINISTRATION 
Board to submit said report within the specified time period shall be deemed lack of opposition
thereto. 
Petitioning for a variance under the procedures of this Section and a subsequent approval of such
variance by the ZBA does not supersede the requirement to obtain a special permit for Off-Street
Parking, as applicable, under the procedures of Sections IV.A., IV.B., IV.C. and VI.E. of these
Zoning Ordinances. 
b. Hearings
The ZBA shall hold a hearing on said petition for a variance within 65 days of the date of filing
with the City Clerk. Notice of such hearings shall be published by the ZBA as provided in chapter
40A and Section VI.C of these Zoning Ordinances. 
c. Decisions
The decision of the ZBA shall be made within 100 days after the date of filing of any petition for
a variance with the City Clerk. The concurring vote of all of the members of the Board shall be
necessary to render a decision on any petition for a variance. 
The Board shall make an audible audio tape recording of all its proceedings and deliberations. 
Such recordings shall be kept in the offices of the ZBA for a period of two years, and shall be
made available to any person for listening or copying purposes during regular business hours in
the offices of the ZBA. 
The ZBA shall also keep a detailed written record of the proceedings as required by law, copies
of which shall be filed within 14 days with the City Clerk, and notices of decisions sent to the
appropriate persons as required in Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40A, Section 15. Said
notices shall set forth, the nature and vote of the decision, the reasons therefor, and any conditions
and safeguards prescribed by the ZBA in said decision. Notice of the nature and vote of the
decision shall also be published once by the ZBA in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City, at the expense of the applicant, said publication to occur no more than twelve calendar days
after the filing of the decision with the City Clerk. Said notices shall also be mailed to the City
Councilor in the respective District in which the project is located in, and the two City Councilors
At-Large. 
d. Failure to Act
As provided in G.L. c. 40A, §15, the decision of the ZBA shall be made within one hundred days
after the date of the filing of any petition for variance. The required time limit may be extended
by written agreement between the applicant and the ZBA. A copy of such agreement shall be
filed in the office of the City Clerk. Failure by the ZBA to act within said one hundred days or
extended time, if applicable, shall be deemed to be the grant of the petition. The petitioner who
seeks such approval by reason of the failure of the ZBA to act within the time prescribed shall
notify the City Clerk, in writing, within fourteen days from the expiration of said one hundred
days or extended time, if applicable, of such approval and that notice has been sent by the
petitioner to parties in interest. The petitioner shall send such notice to parties in interest, by mail
and each notice shall specify that appeals, if any, shall be made pursuant to G.L. c. 40A, §17 and
shall be filed within twenty days after the date the City Clerk received such written notice from
the petitioner that the board failed to act within the time prescribed. 
3. Conditions of Issuance of Variances
The ZBA may authorize a departure from terms of this Ordinance, except as limited above, provided
that each of the following conditions is met: 
(1) There are circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape, or topography of the land or
structures for which the variance is being sought. 
(2) Such circumstances especially affect such land or structures but do not affect generally the zoning
district in which the land or structures are located. 
FEBRUARY 1, 2021  SECTION VI. PAGE 198 
Page 202
 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  SECTION VI. ADMINISTRATION
(3) Owing to such circumstances, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would
involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellant. 
(4) The desired relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without
nullifying or substantially derogating from the purpose and intent of this Ordinance or from the
intent of the district in which the variance is being sought. 
4. Variances in Floodplain Districts
a. The ZBA may grant a variance from Section III.A.3. e and f. (floodplain management
regulations) in the following circumstances.
(1) A variance may be issued for new construction and substantial improvement to be erected on
a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
buildings constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with section 3 above and in
conformance with sections b., c., and d. below. 
(2) The granting of the variance shall not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, or extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or
victimization of the public; or conflict with state or local laws or ordinances. 
(3) A variance may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4) The ZBA shall notify the applicant in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a
building below the base flood level and/or lacking adequate floodproofing will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $l00 of
insurance coverage and that such construction increases risks to life and property. 
b. A variance may be granted for construction on a lot that does not comply with section a.l. above,
but only in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. In such cases the ZBA should be aware
that the Federal Insurance Administrator may review the findings justifying the granting of such
variances, and if that review indicates a pattern inconsistent with the objectives of sound flood
plain management, the City’s participation in the Flood Insurance Program may be jeopardized.
c. Variances may be issued by the ZBA for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of
buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, or the State Inventory of Historic
Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.
d. Variances shall not be granted by the ZBA within any designated regulatory floodway under any
circumstances.
5. Repetitive Petition
No petition for a variance which has been unfavorably and finally acted upon by the ZBA shall be
reconsidered within two years after the date of final unfavorable action unless said Board finds
specific and material changes in the conditions upon which the previous unfavorable action was
based, subject to consent of four out of five members of the Planning Board, and only after notice is
given to interested parties of the time and place of the proceedings when the question of such consent
is considered.
H. SEVERABILITY 
Should any section or provision of these Zoning Ordinances be decided by the courts to be
unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of these Zoning Ordinances as a
whole or in part thereof other than the part so decided to be unconstitutional or invalid.

 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  APPENDIX 1 – LAWS & REGULATIONS 
APPENDIX 1 - LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING LAND USE
Land use in the City of Framingham is subject to regulation under various state and local laws, ordinances, and by-laws. In
addition to the Zoning Ordinance (and its statutory authority, “THE ZONING ACT
”, Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General
Laws), these laws, ordinances, and by-laws include the following: 
1. Subdivision of land is regulated under Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 41, Sections 81K - 81GG (“THE SUBDIVISION CONTROL
LAW
”), and the Framingham Planning Board’s “RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND IN
FRAMINGHAM
”, adopted pursuant to Ch. 41. The “RULES AND REGULATIONS
” set forth standards for the construction of
streets and municipal services and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions. 
2. Development in wetlands is regulated under Section 18. “Framingham Wetlands Protection Ordinance” of Article V.
“Health and Safety” of the CITY OF FRAMINGHAM GENERAL ORDINANCES (see APPENDIX 8 of these Zoning Ordinances)
and the State Wetlands Protection Act, M.G.L. Ch. 131, Sec. 10, administered by the Framingham Conservation
Commission and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management. The Framingham Wetlands Protection
Ordinance and the Wetlands Protection Act provide for public review of proposed projects which involve construction or
other alterations of land in or near wetlands or other land which is subject to periodic flooding. 
3. “Nuisances”, or specific conditions constituting a hazard or blight, may be regulated under Section 22 “Nuisance
Ordinance” of Article V “Health and Safety” of the CITY OF FRAMINGHAM GENERAL ORDINANCES (see APPENDIX 2 of
these Zoning Ordinances), adopted pursuant to the general powers granted to cities and towns by Article 89 of the
Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution and the specific powers granted by M.G.L. Ch. 139, Sec. 1 - 3A. Under
this Ordinance, the Building Commissioner shall investigate reported nuisances, and where present, shall give notice to the
owner and occupant to cease the nuisance. The Building Commissioner shall enforce this Ordinance via a court complaint, 
a fine, or other action as is necessary to enforce the provisions of the Nuisance Ordinance. 
4. Signs are regulated under Section 1 “Sign Ordinance” of Article VII. “Signs and Districts” of the CITY OF FRAMINGHAM
GENERAL ORDINANCE (see APPENDIX 3 of these Zoning Ordinances), adopted pursuant to M.G.L. Chapters 93 and 43B. 
The Sign Ordinance is enforced by the Building Commissioner. 
5. Off-street parking is regulated by the Zoning Ordinances (Sec. IV.A and IV.B.) and the Town’s handicapped parking
ordinance (see APPENDIX 4 of these Zoning Ordinances). Both sets of regulations set forth similar standards with respect to
handicapped parking: the principal difference is that whereas the Building Commissioner is responsible for enforcement of
the Zoning Ordinances, the Police Department is responsible for enforcement of the Handicapped Parking Ordinances. 
Handicapped parking in the City of Framingham is also governed by the standards of the “Americans with Disabilities Act” 
and the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board. 
6. Preservation of Historic or Architecturally Significant Buildings is governed by Section 17A. “Demolition Delay
Ordinance for Historic or Architecturally Significant Buildings” of Article V. “Health and Safety” of the CITY OF
FRAMINGHAM ORDINANCES (see APPENDIX 9 of these Zoning Ordinances).
7. Permits for Access to Public Ways are regulated under Section 8 “Public Way Access Permits” of Article VI. “Roads,
Highways, Bridges, Rubbish Disposal, Water and Sewer” of the CITY OF FRAMINGHAM ORDINANCES (see APPENDIX 10 of
these Zoning Ordinances).
8. Scenic Roads are regulated under Section 10. “Administration of the Scenic Road Act” of Article VI. “Roads, Highways,
Bridges, Rubbish Disposal, Water and Sewer” of the CITY OF FRAMINGHAM GENERAL ORDINANCES (see APPENDIX 11 of
these Zoning Ordinance) and the Scenic Road Act, M.G.L. Ch. 40, Sec. 15C, administered by the Framingham Planning
Board. These regulations provide for public review of proposed projects which involve the cutting or removal of trees, or
the tearing down or destruction of stone walls within the boundaries of roads designated as scenic road by the City. 
In addition to the above laws, ordinances, and regulations, other regulations and standards such as historic district controls, 
utility permit requirements, and the City of Framingham Department of Public Works’ “Construction Standards” may apply to
specific cases.

 FRAMINGHAM ZONING ORDINANCES  APPENDIX 7 – LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS) 
APPENDIX 7 - LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS) 
In Section VI.F. of the Zoning Ordinances (Site Plan Review) the standard set forth for traffic impacts is based on the
concept of “level of service” (“LOS”).  Level of service is a qualitative measure of the operating condition of a
transportation facility, such as an intersection or highway link, at specific traffic volumes. It is divided into six classes
described as follows: 
LOS  OPERATING CONDITIONS 
A  Free flow, low volume, high operating speed, high maneuverability. 
B  Stable flow, moderate volume; speed somewhat restricted by traffic conditions, high maneuverability. 
C  Stable flow, high volume; speed and maneuverability determined by traffic conditions. 
D  Unstable flow, high volumes, tolerable but fluctuating operating speed and maneuverability. 
E  Unstable flow, high volumes approaching roadway capacity, limited speed, 
intermittent vehicle queuing. 
F  Forced flow, volumes lower than capacity due to very low speeds. 
Heavy queuing of vehicles, frequent stoppages.

Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 187, Transportation Research Board, National Research
Council, 1978] 
LOS is determined differently for highways, signalized intersections, and unsignalized intersections. Capacity and level of
service of signalized intersections are determined using a procedure known as Critical Movement Analysis. In this method, 
LOS is determined by vehicle delay and “volume/capacity (V/C) ratio”, which is the sum of “critical volumes” for the
intersection divided by the theoretical capacity of the intersection. The following table summarizes the delay and V/C
values for signalized intersections: 
Level of Se rvice Typical V/C Ratio 
Delay Range
(sec/vehicle) 
A  .00-0.60  0.0-16.0
B  .61-0.70
C  .71-0.80 
6.1-22.0
22.1-28.0
D  0.81-0.90
E  0.91-1.00 
28.1-35.0
35.1-40.0
F  varies  40.1 or greater
