This project includes the design of improvements for the Edgell
Road/Central Street intersection. Design includes preparation
of plans, research regarding right-of-way, traffic simulation
modeling to determine the optimal roadway layout and need
for traffic signalization. Improvements include roadway
layout, curbing, pavement markings, traffic signaling, signage,
crosswalks, sidewalks, drainage improvements, and ADA ramps
as appropriate. 
As noted for the project "Intersection Improvements at
Water/Edmands/Edgell", the Town is currently evaluating a complete street
assessment of Edgell Road from Vernon Street to the intersection with Edmands
Road and Water Street. As part of this study key intersections such as Central
Street are being investigated and evaluated. The Central Street intersection is of
special interest given the high volume of traffic into a densely populated
section of Town. Because improvements at intersections such as Central Street
are more complex than general roadway improvements, a longer lead time is
required to design and construct improvements in these locations.

III-Oakvale Park 
Many of the Parks playgrounds provide limited handicapped accessibility as well
as outdated and potentially hazardous play equipment and safety surfacing.
The Parks and Recreation Department has a play structures list
that is prioritized according to equipment in need of
replacement or upgrade. Phase 3 of this replacement program
will provide funding to significantly improve Oakvale Park. The
budget estimate is based on a project currently under
construction with associated pricing provided by Weston and
Sampson Architectural Firm and includes accessibility
improvements, play equipment, rubber safety mulch and
poured in place rubber surfacing. 
Studies have shown that two-thirds of playground injuries result from falls to
inappropriate surfacing below the equipment. Other injuries often occur from
protrusions, sharp edges, hot surfaces and pinch points. Current equipment at
these locations has been in existence for many years and is far from being in
compliance with current industry standards. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission has established standards for playground equipment and safety 
Parks
surfacing. Traditionally play equipment was not designed with a high degree of
regard for safety standards and handicap accessibility. New equipment and
safety surfacing is designed in conjunction with the new CPS safety guidelines to
eliminate these common problems. This appropriation will provide significantly
improved handicapped accessibility, compliant play equipment and a
combination of poured in place safety surfacing and rubber mulch.

Cushing Phase VI Feasibility Study Cushing Phase 6 Feasibility Study. 
A comprehensive Master Plan was completed in 2001 with significant
cooperation and participation of Town Residents. Cushing has become the
central park in Framingham and is used by hundreds of residents daily for
passive recreation. We propose a feasibility study that will identify the 
Parks
requirements to install a pond, currently proposed for the southern area of the

Current signage throughout our Parks system is outdated and limited with
regard to impact and aesthetics. Beautification of Parks properties lends to
neighborhood stabilization and a sense of pride in community. The Board of
Installation of a signage program for Parks and Recreation
properties throughout town. Proposed phase locations include
Longs Athletic Complex, Arlington Street Park, Apple Street
Park, Little League Complex at Longs, Mt. Wayte Park,
Roosevelt Park, Anna Murphy Park and Bates Road Park. 
Selectmen Vision Statement indicates "Our Town will foster a sense of pride by
placing a high priority on quality education, neighborhood parks ... and promote
a clean and beautiful Town." The "Choose Framingham" initiative identifies the
fact that "the average distance to a playground or other recreation area from
any single family parcel is approximately a quarter of a mile." Proposed signage
will create a common theme for all Park properties, while improving the 
Parks
aesthetics and beautifying the neighborhoods and the Town. This signage
program is a low cost way to advance both the Board of Selectmen Vision
Statement and the "Choose Framingham" initiative.

reliable service life of sewer system assets. Infiltration reduces the capacity for
sewage flow, can result in back ups and overflows, and increases the billings
from MWRA, which is based on total sewer flow from Framingham. Phase 1
repairs were implemented in late 2017 for defects at and south of Waverly

This appropriation will provide for the replacement and
upgrades of equipment at older wastewater pumping stations.
The project includes the planned replacement of pumps,
motors, controls and others, as well as emergency
replacements. 
The lifespan and reliability of these stations can be extended a decade or more
through the replacement of component parts as they become worn and
inefficient, thereby reducing the near-term need for significant capital funds.
For example, underground controls and Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems may be considered to be raised above ground for
reduction of corrosion and for safety purposes.

This project includes the design of improvements for the

preparation of plans, research regarding right-of-way, traffic
simulation modeling to determine the optimal roadway
layout and need for traffic signalization. Improvements
include roadway layout, curbing, pavement markings, traffic
signaling, signage, crosswalks, sidewalks, drainage
improvements, and ADA ramps as appropriate. 
As noted for the project "Intersection Improvements at
Water/Edmands/Edgell", the Town is currently evaluating a complete street
assessment of Edgell Road from Vernon Street to the intersection with
Edmands Road and Water Street. As part of this study key intersections such as
Central Street are being investigated and evaluated. The Central Street
intersection is of special interest given the high volume of traffic into a densely
populated section of Town. Because improvements at intersections such as
Central Street are more complex than general roadway improvements, a longer
lead time is required to design and construct improvements in these locations.

(Open Space Acquisition) Expansion of
Cushing Memorial Park 
Acquisition of land adjacent to Cushing Memorial Park. 
The Parks Department recently completed an update to the Cushing Memorial
Park Master Plan. This update was conducted utilizing formal and informal
input from the residents of Framingham as a means to determine how the
community viewed this parcel of land and what future improvements to the site
should be considered. The Cushing Master Plan Update identifies several
priorities. Priority Number Two - Land Acquisition for Park Expansion calls for
the acquisition of a large tract of privately owned land contiguous to the
northern border of Cushing Memorial Park. This property is the last remaining
large parcel of privately owned and undeveloped land in the area. The location
of this parcel, adjacent to the park, creates a unique opportunity for the Town
to potentially expand the current park, preserve additional open space and 
Parks
introduce new amenities to further enhance public enjoyment of the property.
This privately owned parcel has been permitted for further development by the
abutting Emeritus Facility, with approved plans already on file with the Planning
Board. Completion of the approved plans by Emeritus includes the potential
for several multi-story buildings to be built at the site, many adjacent to the
Cushing Chapel. These new buildings will create a significantly degraded park
experience compared to what patrons currently encounter within the park.
Illustrations depicting this build out are excerpted from the Cushing Master Plan
Update and included with the backup documentation for this project.

This mobile stage will allow for versatility in presenting community events.
Currently the Town of Framingham hosts several cultural and musical events
annually that would benefit from this piece of equipment. These events include
concerts on the common, graduations, Flag Day celebration and a community
bonfire. In addition to these events, we receive requests from residents and
local corporations to host fund raisers, registrations, cookouts and gatherings at Parks
our parks. This equipment would be beneficial to those requests as well.
Other municipalities have had success renting this equipment out to help offset

require stormwater drainage systems improvements. The five sub-basins in
this study represent medium priority areas in Town, based on infrastructure
condition, water quality, population density, historical flooding, and
vulnerability and hydraulic concerns of a failure of the major system
conveyance infrastructure. Previously studied sub-basins included Beaver
Dam Brook and Farm Pond sub-basins (Phase I) and Angelica Brook,

Framingham is required to operate its storm sewer system under the MS4
General Permit. The new permit has increased unfunded mandates for
compliance including, but not limited to:
• All Town properties will be included in the permit, including but not limited
to schools, parks, conservation areas, and Town facilities whereas previously
permit compliance focused on the roadway drainage system;
• Additional storm sewer system inspections and maintenance will be
required annually;
• Increased inspection and sampling for water quality and potential illicit
discharges will be required;
• Significant increases required for administration, mapping and reporting.
• Increased stormwater management is required for new and
re-development, which is more stringent than the current MassDEP
Stormwater Standards and Town bylaws; and
• Additional operations and capital investments will be required for drainage

This project will provide funds for design of roadway
improvements to the Butterworth Park area. When
constructed the project will provide roadway pavement
rehabilitation (milling and/or reclamation) with the
objective of reducing excess pavement width where
possible; new and reset granite curbing, replacement of
existing sidewalks and construction of new sidewalks and
driveway aprons; and replacement or repair of existing
drainage structures and piping as required.
ADA-compliant sidewalks and wheelchair ramps will be
constructed. In addition, streetscape and lighting
improvements will be incorporated at the same time
which would result in savings as opposed to 
This work will direct roadway investments so that they are coordinated with
future land uses and redevelopment opportunities to improve the
Butterworth Park area. To restore and enhance the safety and function of
this area, we need to utilize the full right-of-way in a "complete streets"
approach, balancing the needs for all users and modes. The improvements
will serve as the foundation of a more cohesive and economically successful
neighborhood. This community-based plan will address roadway, sidewalk,
intersection, lighting, drainage, signing, crosswalk and landscape
improvements for approximately six miles of town streets from Howard
Street to Hartford Street, and from Concord Street (excluding Concord

The lifespan and reliability of these stations can be extended a decade or
more through the replacement of component parts as they become worn
and inefficient, thereby reducing the near-term need for significant capital
funds. For example, underground controls and Supervisory Control and Data

Main project). The project will also evaluate replacement
of 5,500 feet of vitrified clay drain line, which is likely to
be damaged during construction. The project will provide
a survey, borings, and geotechnical analyses sufficient 
The 8 inch asbestos cement sewer pipe is close to 60 years old, and is in
deteriorated shape. In addition, the 2003 MWRA settlement agreement calls
for reduction in force mains to limit noxious sulfide production. The project
will consider combining the southern section of gravity main with the
Woodland Force Main, which would reduce the length of the force main by
up to 1,400 feet, more than half the length of the force main. Combining this
project with the Water project will result in reduced construction costs and

This project will provide funds to comply with new
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System

Framingham is required to operate its storm sewer system under the
MS4 General Permit. The new permit has increased unfunded mandates
for compliance including, but not limited to:
• All Town properties will be included in the permit, including but not
limited to schools, parks, conservation areas, and Town facilities whereas
previously permit compliance focused on the roadway drainage system;
• Additional storm sewer system inspections and maintenance will be
required annually;
• Increased inspection and sampling for water quality and potential illicit
discharges will be required;
• Significant increases required for administration, mapping and
reporting.
• Increased stormwater management is required for new and
re-development, which is more stringent than the current MassDEP
Stormwater Standards and Town bylaws; and
• Additional operations and capital investments will be required for

This project is the final design and construction of
an improved intersection at Salem End Road, Badger
Road, and Gates Street. The improved intersection
will include a roundabout to serve Salem End Road
and Badger Road, and a new intersection to serve
Salem End Road and Gates Street. 
The existing intersection has a history of accidents. Roundabouts have
been constructed for similar intersections in other communities such as
Norfolk, Duxbury, and Somerville, and have led to traffic calming and
reductions in vehicular accidents. This design was selected as being the
safest and most efficient after a review of three alternatives, the others
being a) a four-way signalized intersection and b) two intersections, one
of which would be signalized.

This appropriation will provide for the replacement
and upgrades of equipment at older wastewater
pumping stations. The project includes the planned
replacement of pumps, motors, controls and others,
as well as emergency replacements. 
The lifespan and reliability of these stations can be extended a decade or
more through the replacement of component parts as they become worn
and inefficient, thereby reducing the near-term need for significant
capital funds. For example, underground controls and Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems may be considered to be raised
above ground for reduction of corrosion and for safety purposes.

DPW/Sewer/202
3/7 
The overall project is to line or replace water and
sewer mains between Concord Street and the Natick
town line, as well as the cross-country sewer
connector that runs north from Worcester Road
through Natick, terminating near Cochituate Road.
This work is to be designed and constructed in three
sections (I – Rt 9 eastbound lanes, including the
Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; II –
Westbound lanes; III – north-south sewer
connector), with this request for the construction of
Phase I, and the final design of II and III. 
The need for this project are some undersized pipes, pipe age and
materials, condition, and the consequences of their failure, with this
investment increasing capacity, reliability and fire flow, and reducing
maintenance costs. Most of this infrastructure is between 50 and 100
years old, and they serve major portions of Framingham’s retail
businesses, where emergency repairs and the disruption of service and
traffic would be very costly. The cross-country connector traverses
wetlands, which make maintenance access and emergency repairs
extremely difficult, costly and damaging to the natural resources,
especially during wet periods.

• Increased inspection and sampling for water quality and potential
illicit discharges will be required;
• Significant increases required for administration, mapping and
reporting.
• Increased stormwater management is required for new and

Increased programming in the Parks and Recreation Dept., School
Dept. and community user groups results in an immediate need for
additional space to schedule events. The most effective short term
means of meeting these needs is extending the hours of use for
various locations throughout the Town. Addition of lighting to this
field will enable scheduling of events into the evening, increasing
scheduling flexibility and field availability to meet increased user

demand. In addition to scheduling flexibility, addition of lights to
this field will allow for the entire men's softball league to run at the

young children playing baseball with adults playing softball on
adjacent fields. Currently there is no lighting on this field.

The present lights are over 12 years old. After a certain number of
hours in use, the output of the lamps reduces by approximately
40%-50% of original lighting capacity. Industry standards require
specific lighting levels to ensure safe play. Routine replacement of
lamps and maintenance of fixtures to provide accurate aiming and

Current signage throughout our Parks is outdated and limited in
impact as well as aesthetics. Beautification of Parks properties
lends to neighborhood stabilization and a sense of pride in
