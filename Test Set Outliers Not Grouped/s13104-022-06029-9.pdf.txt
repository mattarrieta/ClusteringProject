Hyperspectral time series datasets of maize
during the grain filling period

Abstract 
Objectives:  Remotely sensed hyperspectral data are increasingly being used to assess crop development and
growth throughout the growing season. Large datasets capturing key growth stages can be useful to research-
ers studying many physiological plant responses. A time series analysis of hyperspectral reflectance measurements
taken during the grain filling period and published within a publicly accessible database are described herein. These
datasets document the spectral reflectance pattern of the canopy within the visible and near-infrared portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum during the late stages of the grain filling period as plants approach and reach physiological
maturity.
Data description:  Included within the data repository are canopy-level hyperspectral datasets collected in 2017 and
2018. Data is included in its raw form, as well as with several manipulations to smooth and standardize the raw data. 
Data are released as comma separated value spreadsheets as well as Microsoft Excel open XLSX spreadsheets. These
are accompanied by README text files which further describe the data and supplemental files that record hybrids
used and plant phenology for each year of data collection.

Objective
Characterization of plant development and growth
throughout the plant’s lifecycle using hyperspectral
remote sensing technologies is an attractive alterna-
tive to many traditional phenotyping approaches [1].
Time series analyses of crop growth is particularly use-
ful for researchers to analyze the spectral changes occur-
ring through different growth stages or critical phases
of development [2]. Maize (Zea mays L.) has several key
growth stages: vegetative growth, flowering, the grain-
filling period, and physiological maturity (a.k.a.,  black
layer) [3]. Many spectral reflectance-based phenotyping
approaches are being examined for their utility in maize
[3, 4]. In this paper we describe a set of spectral reflec-
tance data collected from 16 single-cross maize hybrids

during the later stages of growth for 2 years (2017 &
2018). This dataset specifically describes canopy reflec-
tance in 3 nm increments from the visible through the
near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum
starting at 3-weeks post silking and continuing until
physiological maturity.
Data description
Included within the data repository are several hyper-
spectral reflectance datasets and their manipulations. 
Files follow a naming structure of YEAR_DATA TYPE_
MANIPULATION (Data Files 1–20, Table 1),  where
YEAR can be either 2017 or 2018, DATA TYPE is either
the full dataset or the data averaged for every genotype
on each sampling date across replications, and MANIPU-
LATION is raw data, data that has been standardized by
dividing reflectance at every wavelength by reflectance at
849.5 nm, data smoothed by calculating a rolling average

methods and manipulations are described in the Data
File 21 README file, and variable names and descrip-
tions are included in the Data File 22 CODEBOOK file
(Table 1).  Information about the single-cross hybrids
used in the study and their inbred parents are found
in the Data File 23 GENETIC_MATERIALS datafile
(Table 1). Date of flowering (i.e., appearance of the silks) 
and of physiological maturity (i.e., appearance of black
layer) are found in Data File 24 and 25 PHENOLOGY
datafiles for 2017 and 2018 (Table 1). A SUPPLEMEN-
TARY_IMAGES file is also included (Data File 26), which
contains images of the experimental setup, examples of
black layer, and an example graph of spectral reflectance
(Table 1). All files contained within the data repository
and their file type can be found in Table 1.
Data collection
Experimental setup
The experiment was set up as a randomized complete
block design with four replications, planted on May 12, 
2017 and May 10, 2018 at the Elora Research Station
(Elora, Ontario; 43° 38 ′ 27.0456" N, 80° 24′ 18.6948" W).
Genotypes consisted of four extremely short-sea-
son hybrids, referred to as the Set 1 hybrids, and 12 
short-season hybrids referred to as the Set 2 hybrids. The
inbred line parents for two of the hybrids in Set 1 and for
all Set 2 hybrids are publicly available and have been gen-
otyped [6]. Set 1 hybrids were planted in a late planted
experiment (May 29, 2017 and May 21, 2018) to sample
spectral reflectance differences within a growing season. 
Environmental conditions such as air temperature, rain-
fall, wind speed and direction, and solar radiation were
recorded at the Elora Weather Station, located on the
Elora Research station. This information is publicly avail-
able for both 2017 [7] and 2018 [8].
Data collection
Canopy-level hyperspectral measurements were taken
using a ground based dual-channel reflectance spec-
trometer (Unispec-DC; PP Systems). This is a 243-chan-
nel sensor with a spectral range of 300.4–1101.8 nm, and
a spectral resolution of 3.3 nm. Scans were calibrated
using a spectralon tile (spectralon 12 × 12 inch calibrated
white; ASD Inc) with 99.5% reflectance across the visual
and near infrared spectrum. Sampling was done within
3 h of solar noon, typically after dew was gone from
plants and on days without rain. Scans were taken start-
ing 3 weeks post silking and continued every 2 to 4 days
until physiological maturity, weather permitting.
Limitations
Errors and missing data were dealt with in a defined
manner. For the hyperspectral data collection, when
machine errors occur, they are automatically given the

value 9999 within the dataset, which were then replaced
with a decimal and treated as missing data. Scans that
were completely missed were populated with decimals
and likewise treated as missing data. Zeros in the data-
set were treated as true zeros, although it is possible that
some of these are machine errors or the machine round-
ing down extremely small values rather than true zeros.
Although both years of data were planted at the Elora
Research Station, due to crop rotation practices, the field
which the trial was planted in changed year-to-year, and
thus different soil environments may have been present. 
Weather played a large role on when sampling could
occur, as conditions had to be dry as to not damage the
machine, leading to different lengths of time between
sampling dates.
