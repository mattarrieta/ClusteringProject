Fee should be calculated using the following process & worksheet. Please see Instructions before
filling out worksheet. 
Step 1/Type of Activity: Describe each type of activity that will occur in wetland resource area and buffer zone. 
Step 2/Number of Activities: Identify the number of each type of activity. 
Step 3/Individual Activity Fee: Identify each activity fee from the six project categories listed in the instructions. 
Step 4/Subtotal Activity Fee: Multiply the number of activities (identified in Step 2) times the fee per category
(identified in Step 3) to reach a subtotal fee amount. Note: If any of these activities are in a Riverfront Area in
addition to another Resource Area or the Buffer Zone, the fee per activity should be multiplied by 1.5 and then
added to the subtotal amount. 
Step 5/Total Project Fee: Determine the total project fee by adding the subtotal amounts from Step 4. 
Step 6/Fee Payments: To calculate the state share of the fee, divide the total fee in half and subtract $12.50. To
calculate the city/town share of the fee, divide the total fee in half and add $12.50.
