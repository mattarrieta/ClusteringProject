Framingham Development Plans
• Complete Streets Policy – March 6, 2015
• Nobscot Economic Development Action Plan – September 2015
- “Intersection redesign that examines optimal turning radii 
and the addition of turn lanes where warranted.”
- “Efficiency of vehicular flow should not occur to the detriment 
of pedestrian priority or safety at the center of the district.”
- “Aggressive Expansion of Walkability.”
• Framingham Bicycle & Pedestrian Plan – 2017
- “Streets must balance the needs to all users, taking into account the needs of adjacent land uses
and development goals of an area. Motorist convenience and parking needs should be weighed
against the benefits of encouraging walking, biking, and transit ridership, keeping in mind that auto
congestion and parking needs are lessened when people have safe and convenient alternatives for
travel.”

Proposed Design and Lane Designation
• Many factors are considered during design: 
• Type or classification of roadways
• Vehicle turning movements
• Vehicle volumes, travel speeds, and crash history
• Turn lanes (number required and length needed)
• Pedestrian and Bicycle accommodations
• Length of Crosswalks for pedestrians
• Adjacent land use
• Why no northbound right-turn lane?
