Denasalization
In phonetics, denasalization is the loss of nasal airflow in a nasal
sound, such as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_consonant"] nasal consonant or a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_vowel"] nasal vowel.[1] That may be
due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_pathology"] speech pathology but also occurs when the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinus"] sinuses are
blocked from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"] common cold, when it is called a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_voice"] nasal voice,
which is not a linguistic term.[2] Acoustically, it is the "absence of
the expected nasal resonance."[3] The symbol in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensions_to_the_International_Phonetic_Alphabet"] Extended IPA
is ⟨◌͊⟩. 
Denasalized
◌͊
When one speaks with a cold, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"] nasal passages still function as a resonant cavity so a denasalized nasal
[m͊ ] does not sound like a voiced oral stop [b], and a denasalized vowel [a͊] does not sound like an oral
vowel [a].
However, there are cases of historical or allophonic denasalization that have produced oral stops. In some
languages with nasal vowels, such as Paicĩ, nasal consonants may occur only before nasal vowels; before
oral vowels, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenasalized_stop"] prenasalized stops are found. That allophonic variation is likely to be from a historical process
of partial denasalization.
Similarly, several languages around [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound"] Puget Sound underwent a process of denasalization about 100 years
ago. Except in special [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_register"] speech registers, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_talk"] baby talk, the nasals [m, n] became the voiced stops [b, d].
It appears from historical records that there was an intermediate stage in which the stops were prenasalized
stops [ᵐb, ⁿd] or poststopped nasals [mᵇ, nᵈ].
Something similar has occurred with word-initial nasals in Korean; in some contexts, /m/,  /n/ are
denasalized to [b, d]. The process is sometimes represented with the IPA [m͊ ] and [n͊], which simply places
the IPA ◌͊ denasalization diacritic on [m] and [n] to show the underlying phoneme.[4]
In speech pathology, practice varies in whether ⟨m͊ ⟩ is a partially denasalized /m/,  with ⟨b⟩ for full
denasalization, or is a target /m/ whether partially denasalized or a fully denasalized [b].[5]
