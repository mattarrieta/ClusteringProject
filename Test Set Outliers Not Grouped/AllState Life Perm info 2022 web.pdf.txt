PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE
When can I sign up? 
You are eligible to sign up for permanent life insurance within the first 30 days of
employment or during an enrollment period. 
What is permanent life insurance? 
Permanent Life Insurance is a cash value insurance policy. You are eligible to get
coverage for yourself, a spouse or dependent(s). The permanent life policy offers guaranteed
level premiums, cash values and fixed death benefits. The permanent life option is yours to
keep at the rates you are offered when your policy is accepted. 
Why shouldn't I just buy the Term Life Option? 
While Town of Framingham offers you a basic amount even when you are retired, it may
not be enough to cover funeral costs and term insurance ends at some point. The permanent life
option is yours for as long as you continue to pay premiums. 
What are the costs for permanent life insurance? 
Rates are based upon your age and gender. Once your policy is issued your rates are to
remain level. 
Should I wait until I'm older to sign up for this coverage? 
When you get older and are in more need of the insurance you may not be medically
capable of qualifying. The younger you sign up the less the premium will cost. 
Can this policy be deducted from my paycheck as other benefits? 
Yes, the Permanent Life Insurance also includes convenient payroll deductions. 
Can I keep this policy if I leave employment? 
Yes, this policy is portable (YOU OWN IT).  You can take your policy with you at the
same rate as when you were an employee.
