Abstract 
Significant advances in the treatment of HIV infection have been made in the last three decades. Antiretroviral therapy
(ART) is now potent enough to prevent virus replication and stop disease progression. However, ART alone does not
cure the infection, primarily because HIV can persist in stable long-term reservoir cells including latently-infected
CD4 + T cells. A central goal of the HIV research field is to devise strategies to eliminate these reservoirs and thereby
develop a cure for HIV. This requires robust in vivo model systems to facilitate both the further characterization of
persistent HIV reservoirs and evaluation of methods for eliminating latent virus. Humanized mice have proven to be
versatile experimental models for studying many basic aspects of HIV biology. These models consist of immunode-
ficient mice transplanted with human cells or tissues, which allows development of a human immune system that
supports robust infection with HIV. There are many potential applications for new generations of humanized mouse
models in investigating HIV reservoirs and latency, but these models also involve caveats that are important to con-
sider in experimental design and interpretation. This review briefly discusses some of the key strengths and limitations
of humanized mouse models in HIV persistence studies.

Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection depletes
the CD4 + T cells that serve as hosts for the virus, even-
tually leading to the development of acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome [1].  Potent antiretroviral therapy
(ART) consisting of combinations of antiretroviral drugs
that are taken daily is now available, which suppresses
HIV replication and prevents disease progression [2].
However, replication-competent HIV can persist in rare
latently-infected CD4 + T cells and potentially other res-
ervoirs over years of ART [3–5], meaning that ART alone
does not cure HIV infection. Issues including the devel-
opment of virologic drug resistance, high financial cost, 
side-effects of ART drugs, elevated levels of immune acti-
vation despite therapy, adherence/treatment fatigue, and

continued social stigma can all affect people living with
HIV and taking daily ART. Moreover, many HIV-infected
people around the world do not have access to these life-
saving therapies [2]. Developing an HIV cure is therefore
a major focus for the field.
HIV latency and persistence
Latently-infected cells harbor integrated copies of HIV
provirus that typically express little or no RNA and no
viral proteins, but are capable of producing infectious
virions if the cell is stimulated [4–6].  These cells also
decay very slowly during ART and can maintain the
infection for decades [7], possibly proliferating through
clonal expansion via homeostatic or antigen-driven
mechanisms during this time [8]. Other potential reser-
voirs capable of maintaining HIV over long periods of
time during ART are less-well defined but might include
some level of ongoing virus replication in tissues such
as lymph nodes [9] or anatomic reservoirs such as the

central nervous system [10], where the primary infected
cell types are perivascular macrophages and microglial
cells.
A wide range of experimental strategies are being
investigated to achieve the challenging goal of curing
HIV. These include gene therapy approaches intended
to disrupt HIV proviral sequences [11] or critical host
genes required for infection with many HIV strains such
as CCR5 [12], transplantation approaches to replace the
immune system with HIV-resistant cells [13],  geneti-
cally enhancing the antiviral immune response [14],
“kick and kill” [15] approaches to induce expression of
latent virus and then kill the host cell, and “block and
lock” [16] strategies to permanently silence residual pro-
viral genomes (reviewed in [17, 18]). These approaches
are initially developed and tested using in vitro tissue
culture systems. However, such in vitro models do not
provide the complex tissue architecture, cell–cell inter-
actions, metabolism, compartmentalization, circulation, 
and diverse cell and tissue types present in vivo. There-
fore in vivo testing is critical for evaluating the efficacy of
promising strategies identified through in vitro studies.
Given our incomplete understanding of HIV persis-
tence during therapy and the pressing need to develop
methods to eliminate viral reservoirs that remain during
ART, tractable in vivo models are required. One popular
approach to this problem is to utilize humanized mice. 
The goal of this article is to provide a brief and general
overview of the major benefits and limitations of mod-
ern, commonly used humanized mouse models in HIV
persistence research.
Benefits of humanized mice
Currently used model systems to study HIV in vivo
include non-human primates and humanized mice. 
Humanized mice consist of immunodeficient mice that
are transplanted with human cells or tissues, allow-
ing them to be infected with HIV. Many different types
of humanized mice exist, which differ in the specifics
of the background mouse strain, transplanted human
cell or tissue type, timing of transplant, and procedures
used in humanization (reviewed in [19, 20]). However, 
all are intended to recapitulate key aspects of the human
immune system. These models have advanced signifi-
cantly since the early pioneering studies [21–24] that
originally established this experimental approach and
applied it to study HIV. Use of humanized mouse mod-
els has enhanced our understanding of HIV gene func-
tion, replication, cellular tropism, pathogenesis, and
treatment, and are increasingly being applied to studies
directed towards HIV persistence and cure [19]. As is the
case for most scientific models, humanized mice have a
variety of benefits and limitations that should be carefully 
considered when designing experiments and interpreting
results (Table 1).
The major motivator for using humanized mice to
study HIV is that they provide an in vivo model which
permits experimental interventions and sampling that
are not feasible in clinical studies of infected people. 
The viral strain, dose, route of infection, sampling times, 
experimental interventions (such as ART administra-
tion or anti-latency therapies),  and cells/tissues to be
analyzed can all be defined with precision. Tissue sam-
ples from any organ are available for analysis, including
those that can typically not be obtained in clinical stud-
ies. This is particularly important since only around 2% 
of the CD4 + T cells in the body are circulating in the
peripheral blood, and most HIV infection and replication
occurs in tissues, which are also the predominant loca-
tion of HIV reservoir cells [25].
Advanced humanized mouse models such as bone
marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) mice [26] are reconstituted
with an extensive complement of human immune cells in
many tissues throughout the mouse. This means that the
interaction between wild-type HIV and human host cells
including CD4 + T cells and macrophages can be studied
in vivo and do not require prior genetic modification to
overcome virus species barriers. Therefore clinically rel-
evant antiretroviral drugs, broadly neutralizing antibod-
ies, and other reagents that are specific to HIV can be
directly tested, without needing to modify the reagent or
virus as sometimes is required for evaluation in simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or simian-human immu-
nodeficiency (SHIV) model systems [27].
Infection of humanized mice can be achieved through
various methods including the intravenous, intravaginal, 
or intrarectal routes that are most relevant to human
HIV transmission. These mice can therefore be used in
transmission studies focused for example on topical
antiretroviral drugs or pre-exposure prophylaxis [28–30] 
and potentially for evaluations of HIV reservoir estab-
lishment soon after primary infection through physiolog-
ically relevant routes.
The main cell types that are infected by HIV in vivo
are CD4 + T cells and macrophage-lineage cells [31, 
32]. These human cells are present and can be infected
in humanized mice, allowing pathological effects of HIV
variants with different cellular or coreceptor tropism to
be systematically compared and studied [33, 34].  HIV
infection in these models also leads to CD4 + T cell
depletion and has thus been extensively used to study
HIV pathogenesis, including how different HIV gene
products can affect HIV replication and influence the
virus-host interactions that drive HIV disease [35–37].

nodeficient (SCID)-Hu thymus-liver (thy/liv),  Hu-HSC

pound to be used in pilot studies versus larger animal models
Humanized mice are powerful tools for studying HIV persistence and latency. However, as for all model systems they are more suitable for addressing some questions
than others as summarized here
(hematopoietic stem cell),  and BLT mouse, human
immune cells differentiate in vivo from hematopoietic
stem cell precursors. This allows hematopoiesis and
normal immune cell development to be closely studied, 
along with the direct or indirect effects of HIV on this
process [38]. The types of human cells present in the mice
can also be modified by careful selection of human cell/
tissue to be transplanted, recipient mouse strain charac-
teristics, and specific humanization procedures, allow-
ing for example the relative contribution of T cells versus 
macrophages in HIV replication and persistence to be
evaluated in an in vivo environment [33, 34].
Early studies of HIV latency in humanized mice [15, 
39–41] were performed using a SCID-hu thy/liv model
system that largely constrained human cells to the thy/
liv implant, which could be used as an ex vivo source of
latently-infected cells or as a single-tissue in vivo model. 
More recent approaches have focused on models such as
the BLT mouse, which permits systemic reconstitution
with human cells [26], supports the formation of HIV
latency following HIV infection [42, 43], and maintain

persistent reservoirs of virus including latently-infected
CD4 + T cells after treatment with clinically relevant
ART regimens [42–45]. In addition to serving as mod-
els to explore the establishment of latency and tissue
sources of persistent virus during ART, these models also
allow testing of efforts to deplete latent virus. For exam-
ple, agents intended to reverse latency in “kick-and-kill” 
approaches have been directly evaluated in humanized
mouse models [45, 46].
If immune responses against HIV could be sufficiently
augmented during ART then virus may be prevented
from rebounding if ART is stopped, creating a “func-
tional cure” where the virus is permanently kept in check
by the immune system. Alternatively, enhanced anti-HIV
immunity may improve the elimination of latent reser-
voirs if used in conjunction with latency reversing agents
in kick and kill approaches. Therefore, various HIV per-
sistence and cure studies are focused on improving the
innate and adaptive immune response against HIV. Since
the human immune system in modern humanized mouse
models contains cytotoxic cell types including CD8 + T
cells and some natural killer cells, various efforts to aug-
ment anti-HIV immune approaches can also be tested in
these systems [14].
Gene therapy approaches targeting human genetic
sequences can also be directly evaluated in human-
ized mice without the need to tailor target sequences
to a different model species. The fact that some
humanized mouse models support hematopoie-
sis from CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells through
mature immune cells also allows stem cell gene therapy
approaches to be evaluated in these models [47]. Fur-
thermore, evaluation of experimental cytokines or other
intracellular signaling molecules can be performed with-
out concern that commonly observed [48] inter-species
ligand-receptor incompatibilities will occur.
Murine models also typically allow a greater number of
animals to be tested with a given experimental approach
than non-human primate models, allowing differences
in experimental groups to be more easily discerned. Fur-
thermore, small animal sizes allow for easier handling
and care, and lower amounts of test drugs or compounds
to be used during in vivo studies compared with larger
animal studies.
Limitations to humanized mouse studies
One key limitation to the use of humanized mice is
related to their small size. Blood volume and available
cell numbers from tissues are lower than is the case with
larger animal models or infected humans. Therefore, 
bleed volumes are typically restricted to a maximum of
several hundred microliters per sample depending on
animal weight and bleed frequency, with approximately 
1-1.5 mL volumes available at necropsy for a 25 g mouse. 
Humanized BLT mice can harbor millions of resting
CD4 + T cells, but if cells resident in individual tissues
are assessed, then pooled cells from multiple animals
may be required to quantify latently-infected cells in
individual tissues.
Another consideration is the xenograft nature of the
model in which human immune cells are interacting with
mouse tissues. For experiments that involve transplant of
mature human immune cells into immunodeficient mice, 
this often leads to development of graft versus host dis-
ease (GVHD) several weeks post-transplant [49]. Models
where human cells differentiate from stem cells in the
mouse typically do not develop GVHD until much later
than this, if at all. The timing of GVHD onset is depend-
ent on experimental specifics, the types of human tis-
sues engrafted, and recipient mouse strain genotype, and
these have recently been improved to some extent. For
example mice such as the triple knockout (C57Bl/6 with
knockout of recombination activating gene 2, common
gamma chain, and CD47 genes) have been reported to
be healthy for 45 weeks after humanization and could be
treated with ART for 18 weeks [50]. Any human-specific
differences in tissue architecture or interactions between
non-hematopoietic cells and HIV virions or infected
cells would also generally not be captured in these mod-
els unless additional non-hematopoietic human tissue is
implanted [51].
Some changes in the latent or persistent HIV reservoir
in humans may take a long time to occur. While a state of
HIV “deep latency” has not been defined or characterized
at a molecular level, it is possible that the latent provi-
ruses that remain dormant for many years of ART have
different characteristics from those that are most abun-
dant early after therapy initiation. Changes to the latent
reservoir driven by clonal expansion [8, 52] through
homeostasis or antigen-induced proliferation may also
not be fully evident over short experimental time peri-
ods. The limited lifespan of mice and other constraints
of murine model systems including potential GVHD
development may restrict their application to these ques-
tions that are better addressed with other approaches, for
example in larger animal models or using samples from
people living with HIV who have undergone long-term
ART.
Mice with human immune systems cannot be bred in
the same way as genetically modified mice that encode
specific human genes. Instead, each one must be trans-
planted with human cells and/or tissues. For exam-
ple, commonly used BLT mice can be constructed by
implanting fetal thymus and liver tissue under the kidney
capsule of immunodeficient mice, followed by irradiation
and injection of CD34 + stem cells [26].  This requires

microsurgeries conducted by trained investigators and
suitable isolation and biohazard containment conditions
for maintaining immunodeficient mice which will subse-
quently be infected with HIV. The introduced stem cells
also need to be capable of proliferating and differentiat-
ing into a new human immune system. However, the use
of fetal tissue sources of stem cells and transplant mate-
rial, which provide the most robust immune reconstitu-
tion in humanized mice, is now subject to substantial
restrictions in the United States [53].
Humanized mouse models have also not yet advanced
to the point that all aspects of the human immune system
are entirely recapitulated. Adaptive immune responses
can be elicited but have historically proven relatively
weak, and differentiation of stem cells into myeloid and
NK cells is limited (reviewed in [20, 54]).  Additional
advances including, for example, implantation of lung
tissue in addition to the human immune system, have
recently been described that can improve these adaptive
immune responses [51] and further refinements through
genetic modification of recipient mouse strains to express
human cytokines or other immunomodulatory molecules
[48, 54] may lead to improvements in this area.
Finally, while valuable pharmacokinetic and distri-
bution studies of anti-HIV drugs can be conducted in
humanized mice [55], the basal metabolic rate of mice
and humans differs, along with drug pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic properties [56] which must be
considered when designing experiments.
Conclusions
The application of humanized mouse models to studies
of HIV persistence and latency offers a complementary
approach to clinical studies in people living with HIV and
strategies using non-human primates. These models have
provided insights into many aspects of HIV biology, and
their utility as basic science and translational tools in HIV
persistence and cure research is substantial. However, as
is always the case in experimental biology, understand-
ing the caveats of different model systems and selecting
the best approach to address the scientific question under
investigation is critical. As the saying goes: “Always pick
the right tool for the job at hand”.
