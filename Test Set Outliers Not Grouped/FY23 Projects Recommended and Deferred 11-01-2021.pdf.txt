efficiency and clean energy measures across its municipal facilities. Requested funding is important to
not only backing the City's grant request from the Department of Energy Resources, but also to enable
CPFM to continue making progress towards energy goals if it is not awarded funding through the
program given increasing annual competition from across the state as more communities enroll in the
program. As in prior years, CPFM will seek for the most cost-effective and highest-impact projects to
maximize use of this funding. Proposals attached represent the types of projects that CPFM intends to
move forward, however, they may be supplemented or replaced by more cost effective or more
impactful projects identified through ongoing energy analysis of municipal facilities and the municipal
fleet.
The requested funding will support the
development of a comprehensive and
holistic blueprint that establishes clear
actions that Framingham can take to reduce
its emissions and improve local resiliency
built on detailed best practices research, 
analysis and integration of existing plans in
Framingham, and strong community
engagement with a focus on members of our
community most impacted by climate
change. 
Framingham’s 2020 Strategic Plan sets a clear objective to align with the Commonwealth’s target of
Net Zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. To achieve this sizable objective, an actionable
blueprint for Framingham to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, both from municipal and community
sources, is critical. With the implementation of the City's first Sustainability Committee and multiple
ongoing supporting climate planning efforts, it is an advantageous time for the community to begin
development of comprehensive climate action planning. Additionally, development of a comprehensive
climate action plan would help provide further definition to priority items identified in Framingham's
Community Resiliency Building (CRB) Workshop Report on climate change. The proposed climate
action plan will utilize community engagement and best practices to identify the critical measures
Framingham should adopt to improve its sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and
support local climate resiliency. Development of this plan is important to supporting the Sustainability
Committee as it seeks to make long-term improvements in local sustainability.
Replacement of Engine 3
Replace Shift Commander SUV (Car 2)
Replacement of Firefighter Gear

Please See Attachment. Thank You. 
Engine 3 was built in 2008 by Pierce, is the oldest primary response truck serving the City, and will be
approximately 14 years old if replacement is funded in FY23. Engine 3 covers the South side of the
City, having the greatest density of occupancies, and large share of the Fire Department’s calls. The
emergency-vehicle certified mechanics have suggested that the current Engine 3 now has a useful life
of 1 year or less. This project would address the need to get primary response fire trucks on a
standardized replacement cycle. The Department finds that firefighter safety risks and maintenance
costs accelerate when the apparatus have reached 10-12 years of service. This project also includes
the cost to equip the new truck with the required firefighter tools and hose that a fire engine needs to
meet national fire service standards.
Car 2 is used by the on-duty Shift Commander (Deputy Chief) on a 24/7 basis. Replacement has been
deferred for four consecutive years (FY19, FY20, FY21, FY22). This vehicle responds with the Deputy
to all Fire Department calls when multiple resources are activated. The rear compartment contains
incident command post equipment including 2 additional radios, command boards and command
equipment. The current Car 2 is a 2015 Ford Expedition. The vehicle utilizes older technology
electronics that draws a huge power demand, and must remain running in idle for long durations at
activations, leading to increasing frequency of taking the vehicle out of service for repairs. The current
Car 2 would be repurposed within the Fire Department fleet to replace a fleet vehicle with the highest
mileage/hours.
This request is for the first phase of a three phase project to replace firefighter gear used by firefighters
- including bunker coat/pants, helmet and boots. National fire service standards limit the use of such
protective equipment to 10-12 years of service. It is important that firefighter protective gear keep up
with the modern technologies of biohazard and chemical resistance, as well as resistance to the higher
heat fires caused by the increasing plastic fuel loads found in modern property interiors. The current
set of gear was purchased in 2011 or earlier.
The Fire Chief responds to large-scale incidents during and after administrative hours to perform
incident command functions required by national fire service standards. The Chief also serves as an
incident commander when FFD respond to Fire District 14 mutual aid activations. The response SUV
used for these purposes is currently a 2015 Ford Expedition, and is equipped to be used as the
Command Post and on-site communications hub at incidents. This Project would replace the current
Fire Chief SUV and repurpose the current SUV within the Fire Department fleet to replace a fleet
vehicle with the highest mileage/hours. The cost of this project also includes the cost of a new radio
and installation of emergency lighting/siren.

The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital Funding for the
Vehicle and Equipment Replacement Program. The FY2023 Replacement Program includes
replacement of two trucks that are 14 and 15 years old; a tractor that is 16 years old; and a large
mower that is 13 years old. Replacement of these vehicles and equipment would allow the Department
to replace the most deficient, and oldest equipment that poses life safety concerns and operational
inefficiencies. 
This proposal includes replacement of a Ford F450 Crew Cab Dump Truck (truck 11) and a Ford F450
Regular Cab Dump Truck (truck 12). These two trucks are normally used heavily throughout the fleet
on a daily basis. These trucks support year-round operational needs including moving equipment and
materials throughout the City; supporting mowing operations; providing snow removal and sanding
operational support during winter months; and transporting crews from site to site. These trucks are
both past their life expectancy, required costly repairs to pass state inspections, require additional
funding to repair issues, and have begun to rot out in the cab, allowing for fume infiltration into the cab

trucks, a front end loader, ad a large mower
that are well past their useful life expectancy
and present life-safety concerns to City staff. 
Additionally, our proposal includes replacement of our Toro Groundsmaster (equipment 37), and Case
Loader (equipment 24). These two pieces of equipment are also utilized heavily throughout the year on
a daily process and have surpassed its life expectancy. The Toro Groundsmaster is a large mower that
is used 8-9 months of the year on a daily basis. This mower supports operations at a number of
facilities throughout the City and is a unique piece of equipment. The Toro is one of the only pieces of
equipment in fleet that travels throughout the City on roads, instead of being transported by trailer. This
leaves the mower susceptible to suspension damage due to pot holes and rough streets. Additionally, 
this mower is relied upon heavily throughout the year and allows the Department to experience a
number of efficiencies while it is operational. The Case Loader is also used heavily in a number of
aspects throughout the City. The Loader support field maintenance operations, construction projects, 
field improvements, snow removal, and support operations at the Maintenance and Operations
Facility. Both of these pieces of equipment have experiences costly failures that are lingering and
require additional repairs/replacements that will be need to ensure it meets safety standards and
remains in fleet. These repairs total more than the current estimated value of each, and require
replacement. Without these two pieces of equipment, our Department will
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital Funding for the
Winch Tennis and Basketball Court Repair Project. This project will consist of grinding and repaving of
both the tennis courts (6-courts) and basketball court; replacement of two basketball standards; 
replacement of all 6 tennis standards (and nets); as well as replacement of chain link fencing around
the tennis courts. While the ownership of these courts is split evenly between the School Department
and Parks Department (3-courts), the Parks Department is carrying the full replacement of these 6
courts within our capital budget with the full support of the School Department. 
This project will include full replacement of
the failing tennis courts at Winch and
relocation of the failing basketball court. 
Project includes new tennis and basketball
standards, new fencing, and new lighting
structures. 
The expected life-span of these basketball and tennis court is between 10-15 years, with a number of
variables that could increase or decrease the life expectancy. Variables such as heaving from
temperature fluctuations, level of usage, fluctuating weather patterns, and wind loads on fencing that
causes the structures to shift, have all led to the increasing deterioration of these courts. In addition to
these factors, these tennis courts have surpassed the high-end of its life expectancy as these were
originally installed in 1993, making them courts 26 years old. In addition, the basketball court has
surpassed the high-end of its life expectancy as well having been installed during the early 1980’s. 
The Winch Tennis and Basketball Courts are utilized by a wide-range of users throughout the
community. Those users include all levels of the Framingham High School Boy’s and Girl’s Tennis
Teams; gym classes from Framingham High School; various Parks and Recreation programs; various
resident user groups for both pickup games and local leagues; as well as local organizations who
utilize these courts for lessons and recreational enjoyment. The location of these courts are also in an
important area as they are the only lit basketball and tennis courts in the North-side of Framingham as
well as the only courts serving Framingham High School. This project will also include replacement of
the lighting system at both the basketball and tennis courts as these systems are out of date and
utilize older technology. This replacement will include an LED system that is efficient and will ultimately
save the City energy costs during their lifespan. 
Unfortunately, the conditions at these tennis courts are becoming a safety concern for all users. As the
pictures show in the attached presentation, cracks from the shifting of fence and tennis standard posts
have carried into the playing area, creating a trip hazard for athletes; portions of the sealcoating and
pavement have become loose and chipped off of the courts within the playing area; cracks have
become too long and deep to simply be repaired and seal coated, requiring full grinding and repaving
of all 6 courts While these concerns have only grown over

The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital Funding for the
Temple Street Playground Replacement Project. This project will consist of the removal of the current
equipment; installation of new, accessible equipment; safety surfacing; fencing; and accessible
pathways. This project would focus on improvements while working to maintain the nature of this
neighborhood park.
Relocation and replacement of failing, not
ADA compliant playground 
The current play equipment is past its life expectancy and requires replacement. Additionally, the
current equipment is not accessible, and lacks a proper accessible route to connect all park visitors to
the equipment. The current location of the play equipment is along Temple Street and is not fenced in, 
creating potential long-term safety concerns. These deficiencies have led the Department and a
number of residents from the area, to begin working on conceptual designs for full replacement that
would remedy these issues. 
The current conceptual design will address all of these concerns, including moving the play equipment
to a more centralized location within the park; widening the size of the park; incorporating accessible
equipment into the playground; installation of safety surfacing; installing perimeter fencing around the
newly located playground; and installing an accessible pathway that will connect the playground with
the parking lot. This proposal includes funding for continued design, community outreach, and proper
equipment to complete this project. Once these improvements have been completed, this playground
will be accessible for all residents and provide a safe play area for numerous age groups to enjoy. 
For these many reasons, the Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division respectfully requests FY23
Capital Budget funding for the Temple Street Playground Replacement Project. Division staff will be
made available to provide additional information and address any questions, as needed.
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital Funding for Phase
1 of the Fence and Backstop Removal and Replacement Program. The previous fence & backstop
removal and replacement project was funded over 10 years ago, increasing the need for funding of this
project and magnifying the need for proper investments. 
Properly maintained parks, including vertical structures, are integral to neighborhood beautification, 
stabilization, site usability, public safety, and maintaining surrounding property values. The "Choose
Framingham" initiative identifies the fact that "the average distance to a playground or other recreation
area from any single family parcel is approximately a quarter of a mile." By replacing fence and
backstops at park locations, we are able to ensure proper management and safety of our parks and
other facilities.
This project includes replacement of failing, 
aged backstops, field fencing, and safety
fencing 
In addition to maintaining neighborhood parks and other passive recreational facilities throughout the
City, the Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division also maintains all school athletic fields and their
associated fence lines. Parks staff has identified the need to replace various fence lines due to
increased safety concerns that are attributed to normal aging, tree damage, and regular usage. 
Phase I of the Fence and Backstop Removal and Replacement Program includes improvements at the
following Parks & Recreation maintained properties:
•Removal and replacement of inadequate and undersized fencing at Bowditch Baseball Diamond:
o Current fences are 4 feet, creating a safety concern for athletes and field users and leading to
injuries of athletes plying in the outfield;
o Deterioration and age of fences have also created safety concerns;
•Removal and replacement of 16 ft. backstops at two softball fields at the Walsh Complex;
o These backstops have surpassed their life expectancy and are in desperate need of replacement;
•Deterioration due to weather, aging, and usage has left these backstops in poor condition, creating
potential safety concerns for both users and spectators;
•Inadequate for current usage, as there is no canopy on the top of the backstop at Lower and Upper
Walsh Softball Fields, allowing foul balls to go into spectator sections and neighboring properties;
•Installation of wooden guardrail at Cushing Memorial Park, Winter Street parking area:
o Lack of guardrail leaves no protection or separation of Keefe Tech fencing from vehicles;
o Guardrail will prohibit vehicles from parking along this area, reducing the possibility of parked
vehicles blocking access and eliminating emergency vehicle corridor;

The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital Funding for the
replacement of the current public announcement (PA) system at Loring Arena. This project will consist
of the installation of new speakers and audio system throughout the rink; installation of controls in the
press box and office; and overall upgrades to the PA system used during games, practices, open
skate, and all other events at Loring Arena. 
The current system is 10 years old and was designed to function in the former rink and is configured
as such. In the former rink, sound was able to reverberate off of the end walls and bounce back into
the rink and spectator sections, providing clear audio for user’s experience. As a result of the
renovations, the material of the end walls have changed, which has created a challenge in projecting
sound throughout the rink. In addition, the space has changed with the addition of a second floor with
windows for viewing, installation of windows on the four corners of the barrel, and reconfiguration of
the front first floor. The main challenge is usage during spectator events. 
Full replacement of current, in-rink audio and The rink hosts around 60 games a season from September through March, which generates a large
PA system with a system designed for the amount of revenue for the City and helps to offset the operational cost of Loring Arena. What we have
new facility  found is that during these events when there are spectators in the stands, the PA system proves to be
subpar and is unable to project any announcements, including pregame ceremonies and singing of the
national anthem. Throughout the 2018-2019 season, the Loring Arena and Parks Department staff
members received numerous complaints from players, coaches, parents, spectators, Athletic
Directors, presidents of leagues, representatives from the MIAA, and so on regarding the subpar PA
system. 
When the Department was undertaking redesign efforts for the rink, this upgrade was considered at
the time as a component to the project. However, when estimated budgets were presented to City
staff, we were forced to undertake value engineering approaches, which resulted in the removal of this
project and a number of others from the overall renovation project. While the renovations have
received glowing reviews from all users and visitors, the lacking PA system has decreased the user
experience. As a result, we have identified the replacement of the current PA system as a top priority
for Loring Arena. Our goal for this project is to not only improve the user experience but also to
continue to grow the popularity of the rink state-wide by providing a state of the art experience for all.
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital Funding for the
purchase of a Mobile Stage. This project will allow for the purchase of a full sized, mobile stage to
support the concerts; various community events; graduations; programs; etc. throughout the City. 
The Department currently has one stage that is not mobile, 10+ years old, and unable to support the
growing needs of the Recreation Department. The purchase of this mobile stage will allow the
Department to hold concerts at various locations; performance; speeches; graduations; programs; etc. 
throughout the City where adequate power supply is provided. 
Purchase of a portable stage for Recreation
Department and Community events 
In additional, this stage has a larger platform area than the current Summer Concert stage which will
allow for larger bands and performances. This stage will provide an overhang that will protect the
performers and equipment during inclement weather. The stage also features a concert lighting
system that will provide a new aspect for concerts, performance, speeches, etc. A major feature of this
stage is a hydraulic deployment system and leveling jacks, which make setup and break down quick
and efficient. There are also storage compartments on the stage that allow all production equipment
and speakers to be contained within the stage, allowing for easier transit and eliminates the need to
utilize a trailer for the summer. Potential events that will utilize this stage include, but are not limited to
the Summer Concert Series; Graduation; MetroFest; and other community events. This stage will also
allow the Department to create new programs to utilize the stage, such as drama programs; dance
recitals; exhibitions; music programs; etc. 
We believe this stage will provide the Department and City with a much-needed piece of equipment
that will support activities and community events throughout the City. For these reasons, we
respectfully request funding of this purchase.
Vehicle and equipment per Public Work’s
vehicle management and replacement
schedule. The procurement and upkeep of
equipment is a significant factor in providing
cost-effective and reliable service for
systems operation, maintenance, repair, 
rehabilitation and replacements. 
All vehicles and equipment are managed through the Fleet Department and included within a
replacement schedule according to specific criteria, such as age, mileage, and major repairs needed
for continued reliable service. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those
thresholds maintenance increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none
of which provide a return on investment, and they are not sustainable with the current DPW facility and
staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, nearly all vehicles and equipment are
used for the Department’s snow and ice management program which is particularly destructive to
vehicles.

TIP funding.
The design, permitting, and construction of
drainage retrofits within the Lake
Waushakum watershed will improve water
quality and reduce impacts from severe
storms. This project focuses on retrofiting
an existing concrete stormwater outfall pipe
and headwall at Waushakum Beach with
green infrastructure and stormwater
treatment. The retrofit will be designed with
consideration of recreational amenities and
ADA compliance at the City beach. 
A green infrastructure retrofit to the outfall will improve water quality and reduce the frequency of
beach closures by providing treatment for stormwater runoff before it discharges to the lake. MassDEP
and EPA have stated that the lake is not meeting intended water quality for recreational use due to
pollution from phosphorus and turbidity. Waushakum Beach was closed most of the 2020 and 2021
seasons due to water quality issues. Increasing numbers and intensities of storms caused by climate
change appear to be exacerbating the problem. There is also urgency from a regulatory perspective, 
since the City is required by the EPA to install a demonstration project to reduce pollution no later than
June 2024. 
This project supports important City sustainability and environmental justice objectives, and it is
eligible for funding assistance. The project will build upon work conducted using an Accelerating
Climate Resiliency grant obtained by DPW from MAPC for the 50% design to support nature-based
solutions at Waushakum beach. The project will complement recent ADA improvements made by the
Parks, Recreation, & Cultural Affairs Department, partially funded by CDBG. Additionally, the City was
awarded a Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) grant in FY22 for "Building Relationships and
Resilience with MetroWest Environmental Justice Neighborhoods," which will help shape the design
by engaging surrounding economic justice populations and local leadership.
The original 36"x34" stone box culvert (IDs
2505652, 2512002), had been extended with
two 24" concrete pipe culverts. The culverts
are in critical condition and carry Hartford
Street, a busy arterial roadway. 
This culvert was rated "Critical" in the recent Culvert Assessment and Prioritization Report (Dec. 
2020). With a Risk Score of 83, it is considered the most at risk culvert in the City. Part of the stone
portion of the culvert has collapsed and there are critical blockages and deformations. In addition, the
headwall has loose stones and is unstable and existing guardrail is substandard and in disrepair.

Description  Justification
This project will improve intersection
efficiency by adding a right turn lane on
Dudley Road, improve intersection
geometry, increase lengths of existing
turning lanes, provide new pedestrian
crossings, replace the existing temporary
traffic signal, and also construct drainage
improvements to the outfall into Farm Pond, 
which is an Impaired Water Body. 
This project was deferred from the FY20 requests for funding. This project will improve safety for traffic
and pedestrians, replace the temporary traffic signal that does not meet current standards, and
complete drainage improvements that will benefit the water quality of Farm Pond. This project will
complete the upgrades for Fountain Street and Dudley Road, which have included new water and
sewer mains, drainage and roadway improvements, new Fountain Street and Winter Street Bridges, 
upgrades to Loring Arena, and the new Dudley Road multi-use path.

This request is for the design and
construction of "critical" culvert repairs
intended to extend their usage. Locations
include Badger Road, Herbert Street and
Parmenter Road. 
Culverts perform a crucial role in drainage throughout the City. As part of the city wide inventory and
assessment of drainage culverts, the Badger Road, Herbert Street and Parmenter Road culverts were
determined to be in critical condition and in need of attention to prevent failure. Since the report, one
critical culvert has already collapsed. A culvert failure can have serious consequences, with the
potential to cause upstream flooding to residents and businesses; overtop roads, causing unsafe
conditions for travel; and damage other city owned infrastructure, including roads and utilities. These
culvert improvements are not intended to meet stream crossing standards.
The School Street Bridge over the
Cochituate Brook is a reinforced concrete
slab bridge that is 96 years old and is at the
end of its reliable life. Located just east of
the signalized intersection of Concord and
School Street and the northern terminus of
the Cochituate Rail Trail (CRT), the bridge is
a key link in the City's transportation
network. The existing structure is narrow, 
allowing for 2 travel lanes, no shoulders and
one sidewalk. The proposed new bridge will

This project will fund the repair and
rehabilitation of drainage headwalls. This is
anticipated to be a multi-year project and this
funding request is for the first phase of work
which focuses on the damaged headwalls
with the highest consequences of failure. 
The DPW plans to repair or replace 6 to 9
headwalls per year, prioritized by highest risk
of structural failure and largest need for
improved water quality. The headwalls that
are intended to be included in this project
are: in the vicinity of the Framingham High
School, Simpson Dr, and Fenway Dr which 
Repairing and replacing failing headwalls will improve public safety. Failing headwalls are not just
unsightly, the damaged infrastructure can result in drainage problems that can cause localized flooding
and property damage. Additionally, erosion around failing headwalls can also cause property damage
and are a source of water pollution. Over 16 headwalls were identified by recent field investigation as
currently failing and over a dozen more need significant repair.

and Pine Street.
These funds will allow the City to improve
Candlestick Lane, Gaslight Lane, and
Lantern Road to City roadway standards. 
Work will include paving, curbing, drainage
improvements, and signage. These funds
will also support the surveying and legal
services to support public acceptance. 
These roads are currently private roads in the City of Framingham. These roads were created under
subdivision control and were intended for eventual acceptance. These roads were not maintained by a
homeowners association or other consolidated entity and have therefore deteriorated to an
unacceptable level of disrepair. The property owners in this area have requested that the City accept
the roads as public roadways.
The design of the roadway, drains, curbs, 
and sidewalks along the full Central Street
corridor follows the already completed water
and sewer improvement design. This
project’s roadway design will consist of
pavement profiles and sub-base
assessments, modifications to road
surfacing and geometry, and upgrades to
meet ADA sidewalk, ramp, and curb
requirements. The work will include review
and identification of right-of-way needs and
preparation of easement plans for as many
as ten properties. Approximately 5,050 LF of
drain will be television inspected and 
A sidewalk accessibility study, and road and sidewalk condition assessment found that improvements
are needed to meet ADA requirements. Sections of the drain are known to be in poor condition and
require rehabilitation. Upgrades to Central Street water and sewer infrastructure are already under
design and are closely tied to drainage improvements, largely because of the proximity of pipes to one
another and the opportunity to minimize overall costs and disruption to neighborhoods by upgrading
drainage infrastructure concurrently with water and sewer infrastructure upgrades. Construction for
water and sewer improvements will have impacts on the roadway, curbs, and sidewalks, and they will
need to be upgraded following utility construction.
assessed, and as many as 10,600 LF of
drain will be considered for trenchless
rehabilitation. Up to ten stormwater outfall
locations will be located, mapped, and
assessed.

Description  Justification
MassDOT Project #606109, is the
depression of Route 135 under Route 126. 
The estimated construction cost is $115M. 
This funding would be used to advance
preliminary design activities including the
investigation of public and private utility
conflicts, preliminary highway and bridge
design, evaluation of right-of-way impacts
and coordination with the MBTA and private
utility companies. 
The intersection of Routes 126 and 135 and the MBTA & CSX railroad is a source of significant
congestion. After being studied for over a century, the State's Long Range Transportation Plan
includes this construction project to depress Route 135 under Route 126.
Roof Replacement at Farley School

We have submitted a SOI to the MSBA for their accelerated roof repair program to potential help
reduce the cost of these replacements for the City. We are awaiting a decision on whether the District
has been accepted into the program. Both roofs are failing, experience moisture infiltration at
numerous locations, fascia damage, and either expired warranties or warranty is set to expire within
the next fiscal year.

asbestos must be monitored, and if found to be in poor condition or in a state where asbestos
particulates may become airborne, then it must be repaired or removed. Brophy Elementary School is
one of several older schools that contain asbestos that has been identified as needing attention. 
Ceilings, floors and pipe coverings above the ceilings are the next area of priority for removing
asbestos containing materials. Even though there is no imminent danger of the material becoming
airborne or “friable”, the Department sets removal as a priority before the material becomes
dangerous.
Replacement and repairs to three fire alarm
systems at Brophy, Potter, and Hemenway
Schools 
Currently, Hemenway, Brophy, and Potter Road School's all operate on the same fire alarm system, a
faraday addressable system. These systems were installed in 1999 and unfortunately, Faraday no
longer produces replacement parts. To ensure these buildings remain protected and to minimize
costs, the Department proposes full replacement of the system at Hemenway, removing the Faraday
system, and repurposing it for utilization at Brophy and Potter Road. These parts would repair those
systems while replacing the system at Hemenway. This approach was proposed and recommended by
Custom Alarm, who provides fire alarm protection support to the Department. Additionally, this would
extend the life of the systems at Brophy and Potter Road while reducing the overall project costs.
Security Enhancement Throughout the
District 
The School Department has implemented increased security measures throughout the District. This
year we are requesting additional funds to support proposal for the following enhanced Security
systems throughout the district to include enhancement function modules, badging system upgrade, 
wireless indoor / outdoor lockdown system, security gate installation, alarm upgrade panel and access
controls for doors.

Description  Justification
Purchase and installation of a generator for
the Farley Building 
Project includes purchase and installation of an appropriately sized generator at the Farley Building. 
The current generator is greatly undersized for the Districts needs now that the building is occupied by
central office staff. This project would allow for the installation of an appropriately sized generator that
will provide coverage for the newly relocated offices. Additionally, this generator will be designed to
support future operational expansion within the building, allowing for continued operations of the
District's Central Office during power outages.
We utilize four separate appliances from Barracuda to provide web filtering, spam filtering, email
archiving with cloud replication and backup of all datasets which includes offsite cloud replication. 
These appliances and subscriptions were purchased in FY19 and will be out of warranty and
subscription services in FY23. To renew subscriptions for one year on all four appliances would be

backup solution 
$142,500 annually; these subscriptions include hardware warranty with instant replacement, firmware, 
spam and web filtering engine updates, backup and mail archiver cloud replication and the ability to
operate servers in their cloud environment. To keep the hardware up to date and include 5 years of
subscription services, the cost would be $499,000, or $166,333/year for 3 years. This includes a
discount from the vendor of over 50%. At $142,500/year for renewal of the existing subscriptions and
hardware, this would save the City $212,501 over the course of 5 years if we purchase the new
appliances. By purchasing new equipment, we are better positioned for the always evolving threat
landscape and future growth requirements.
Our current ASA/Firewall will be end of
life/end of support. The ASA/Firewall is
used to protect the network from intrusion
and is also used to manage remote access
to the network (VPN). At this time our
current equipment can't keep up with the
threat landscape. 
We have diligently kept up with our firewall and Security technology, however presently we have been
reaching some hurdles we cannot currently overcome. 
We keep hitting limitations on the software and hardware options due to our current hardware
Platform. The software in use, Firepower, was not originally written for our hardware. The software
was re-engineered and adapted to the ASA platform; however, we are not capable of running all of the
next-generation features available to us. No new software is being written for the ASA platform, but
Cisco will continue to provide critical security patches and definition updates until our existing
hardware goes end of support. Our existing firewalls are 6 years old; they have gone end of sale. 
There is an end of support date from Cisco of September 30, 2025.
In today’s world of network security and requirements, the entire network is your security platform. 
Framingham has made impressive progress in these areas with our addition of Cisco AMP
(desktop/server Anti-Virus), Cisco Umbrella (DNS inspection and Blocking), Cisco DUO (multifactor
Authentication), And Foresite logging and Monitoring through ePlus. All these products integrate and
interact with each other enhancing our security foot print all the way out to our remote desktop and
‘edge’ systems.
Upgrading our Firewalls to new Firepower based hardware and software will improve integration with
these products, thus improving our security posture and increasing the benefits of our investment. In
addition, we will be able to implement SSL decryption (This is decryption of traffic at the packet level
for HTTPS connections). 99% of all web sites are SSL encrypted for security, however Our current
firewalls are not capable of deep inspection of this traffic, which is becoming increasingly necessary.
Working with Cisco, ePlus and Foresite we have a recommendation for a firewall replacement, this
would be for a HA(High availability) firepower pair of firewalls capable of running all of the next
generation firewall options including SSL decryption with tighter integrations into our existing security
posture. Some addition enhancements/improvements are: SecureX security platform included, SSL
decryption, Ransomware defense, support enhancements for the remote workforce, to name a few. 
Without this investment and the changes in the threat landscape and numerous ransomware attacks
that are targeting local Municipalities and K-12 Schools, the City of Framingham is at a high risk.
In addition, it is recommended that we Migrate our Cisco security products into a security EA
(Enterprise Agreement) with Cisco, gaining us a substantial saving over a three (3) year period and
better flexibility on licensing growth.
Vehicle and equipment per Public Work’s
vehicle management and replacement
schedule. The procurement and upkeep of
equipment is a significant factor in providing
cost-effective and reliable service for
systems operation, maintenance, repair, 
rehabilitation and replacements. 
All vehicles and equipment are managed through the Fleet Department and included within a
replacement schedule according to specific criteria, such as age, mileage, and major repairs needed
for continued reliable service. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those
thresholds maintenance increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none
of which provide a return on investment, and they are not sustainable with the current DPW facility and
staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, nearly all vehicles and equipment are
used for the Department’s snow and ice management program which is particularly destructive to
vehicles.

sewer work will be to shorten the force main
and correspondingly increase the size of the
gravity sewer to enable it to receive the flow
from the force main.
The SSES Phase 7 area includes the
Angelica Dr./ Lanewood area; the area
bounded by Winter St. & Mt. Wayte Ave.;
and the area bounded by Central St.,
Concord St., & Summer St. These three
areas combine to account for 96,000 linear
feet of sewer main. The proposed work for
SSES Phase 7 includes (a) flow isolation
and CCTV to identify infiltration and (b) 
smoke testing, dye testing, and building
inspections to identify inflow. 
As part of a 2007 Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Administrative
Consent Order (ACO), the city is required by DEP to identify sources of rainwater runoff and
groundwater that enter the sanitary sewer system. The addition of clean water from improper sources
uses valuable sewer pipe capacity and can cause sewer back-ups into homes or sewer overflows onto
public streets and into rivers/ponds during wet weather events. The City of Framingham has
approximately 62 miles of gravity sewer and force main and 240 manholes. Work conducted under
SSES Phases 1-5 has resulted in the estimated removal of 50% of the 392,000 gallons per day (gpd) 
of identified infiltration. Phase 6 is currently ongoing. Phase 7 is a continuation of this DEP mandated
program. Sewer miles and manholes within this study area only? 96,000 LF
This project will replace about 3,730 feet of
gravity sewers on Pleasant Street and
Temple Street and about 1,580 feet of sewer
force main from the pumping station to the
terminus near the Brophy School. The The Pleasant Street sewers have experienced capacity issues, including sanitary sewer overflows and
gravity sewer extends from the pump station manhole surcharging. In addition, they are old and in need of upgrading, especially with the potential

vehicle management and replacement
schedule. The procurement and upkeep of
equipment is a significant factor in providing
cost-effective and reliable service for
systems operation, maintenance, repair, 
rehabilitation and replacements. 
All vehicles and equipment are managed through the Fleet Department and included within a
replacement schedule according to specific criteria, such as age, mileage, and major repairs needed
for continued reliable service. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those
thresholds maintenance increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none
of which provide a return on investment, and they are not sustainable with the current DPW facility and
staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, nearly all vehicles and equipment are
used for the Department’s snow and ice management program which is particularly destructive to
vehicles.

This funding request is for upgrading
approximately 5,000 feet of existing 6-inch
cast iron and 8-inch asbestos-cement water
main with new 12" cement-lined ductile iron
main. The area of work will be on Pleasant
St. from just west of Belknap Rd. to Vernon
St. and on Temple St. from Pleasant St. to
the Mass Pike. The project will also include
new connections to side streets, valves, 
hydrants, and copper services to each
customer's property line. 
The water mains along these streets require replacement due to their age, condition, size and
materials, and will be less costly if constructed at the same time as the planned sewer repairs and
replacements in Pleasant Street. All are more than 7 decades old. The 8-inch main on Pleasant Street
is beneath the curb and difficult to access for repairs. The 6-inch diameter cast iron main on Temple
Street is unlined, which has led to interior tuberculation and corrosion causing decreased capacity. 
Replacement will improve flow capacity and substantially increase reliability of the water system in this
area. This is also an opportunity to combine the much-needed sewer system improvements in the area
with the water main improvements, resulting in lower construction costs and minimizing disruption to
the neighborhood and commuters in this busy corridor.
