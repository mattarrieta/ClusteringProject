Motor Vehicle Crash Operator Report
When should I complete a Crash Report? 
M.G.L. Chapter 90, Section 26 requires a person who was operating a motor vehicle involved in a crash in which (i) any
person was killed or (ii) injured or (iii) in which there was damage in excess of $1,000 to any one vehicle or other property, 
to complete and file a Crash Operator Report with the Registrar within five (5) days after such crash (unless the person is
physically incapable of doing so due to incapacity). The person completing the report must also send a copy of the report
to the police department having jurisdiction on the way where the crash occurred. If the operator is incapacitated but is not
the vehicle’s owner, the owner is required to file the crash report within the five (5) days based on his/her knowledge and
information obtained about the crash. The Registrar may require the owner or operator to supplement the report and he/
she can revoke or suspend the license of any person violating any provision of this legal requirement. A police department
is required to accept a report filed by an owner or operator whose vehicle has been damaged in a crash in which another
person unlawfully left the scene even if damage to the vehicle does not exceed $1,000.
